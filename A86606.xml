            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I have diverted my ſelf enough with theſe Poems and Tractates; ſo I now beſtow them on the world. If it finde cauſe to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in their reception, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: However, I am pleas'd, and will be.</p>
            <p>I threaten none with Wit, who cannot, or are not willing to finde it: If they do not perceive, or yield to my ſenſe, I ſhall be bold to conclude as little of theirs; and ſo we are even however.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:154213:4"/>
            <p>If this Age, (of which I am a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) be not as Ingenions as I could wiſh, I am as inclinable to grant my defects amongſt other mens.</p>
            <p>To diſpute the concerns of Wit, were to be engaged in Follies and Trifles; and I am not ſo deſirous to be a fool of my own making; I will leave that to Criticks, to do for me; or ſuch Curious heads that can ſpin Senſe into Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe.</p>
            <p>If my Wit be accompliſh'd enough to be my <hi>Zany,</hi> I care not much if my Jeſts fit not other men; or if I play with my Muſe with as much content as <hi>Montaigne</hi> did with his Cat, ſo I ſcratch no Bodies Face, or Fingers, I will uſe my liberty without asking leave.</p>
            <p>I have here writ Eſſays and Poems, and I have Reaſon enough to expect ſome big looks on both, ſince few have been granted to do either well. But I aſſure
<pb facs="tcp:154213:4"/>all ſuch, that I will not be inquiſitive of my ſucceſs in their faces, no more than I ſhall Interrogate my Stationer whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Book paſſeth beſt by Whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale, or by Retail: 'tis on his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, if too much of my paper lyes on his hands.</p>
            <p>I have debarr'd my ſelf already the asking pardon for faults, by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging my ſatisfaction in what I have done: Though the contrary be the modeſt Artifice of ſome to beget praiſe: A Farce, though tranſlated, is not now adayes Printed without it; whereas I deſire no Jugling with my Reader, or my ſelf.</p>
            <p>If I have been too airy or wanton in ſome of my Poems, he may finde me more ſerious in others: It was <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>'s vein; and he ſucceeded well enough in both. The truth is, my Muſe took ſome incouragement from thence; at leaſt
<pb facs="tcp:154213:5"/>had not appear'd ſo much a Libertine, had it not been for his ſake, and the Reflexions I have made uſe of from him in ſome few places.</p>
            <p>I have only this Apology to make to Ladies, that where they apprehend my Muſe too much a <hi>Wanton,</hi> they would manage accordingly their bluſhes before their Servants and Admirers; not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (where I have hit their fancies) they may as much ſmile when alone: nor can I but pity the Artificial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of the fair Sex, in being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to diſſemble (with no ſmall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to themſelves) their ſoft Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
            <p>Love-Verſes will have ſomething of their Comick part, or they will ſeem unmanly, or unpleaſant: our Amours have but one natural way of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; and their Wit muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:154213:5"/>
            <p>Poets have been alwayes great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the feals of <hi>Cupid,</hi> and I believe had they feigned Nine hundred Muſes inſtead of Nine, their Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had been moſt devoted to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. A late Ingenious Writer ſays, pleaſantly enough, that Poets are not free of their Profeſſion until they have throughly dealt in the affairs of Love. My Compoſitions here, of that kinde, have coſt me but few Weeks; and I ſhall be glad to purchaſe my freedom in ſo ſhort a time: They may perhaps ſhew me a Lover, and my Inclinations no leſs ready to Intrigue with my Wit; it is all the excuſe I can make, ſhould my Pen be thought otherwiſe Impertinent, or to have nothing to do with my ſelf: as alſo I am ſo charitable, to believe that no man with any delight to his thoughts could concern his brain this way, if abſolutely a stranger to its paſſion; which
<pb facs="tcp:154213:6"/>is ſo much Mankind's, that upon the matter 'tis every mans; and I will take leave to ſuppoſe ſo of Women. You have the Apology of my Muſe in Proſe, and you ſhall have another immediately in Verſe.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thank Heaven that I have taken ſo far leave of my Muſe, as to come from Verſe to Proſe, which I take to be ſomewhat a better way of Writing plain <hi>Engliſh;</hi> though I find I can cramp Words as well as another, or leave a Line with a foot or two of ſenſe more than it needs; and beſides that, I have as many <hi>to's</hi> and <hi>do's, prove's</hi> and <hi>love's,</hi> with ſuch other neceſſary Implements, as the beſt Toner of them all. There's nothing that I find our Language ſo plentifully affords, or that falls on my pate with ſo little invocation of my ſenſe, as Rhime does; I find it fattens the moſt thin and barren parts of <hi>Pernaſſus,</hi> as much in faſhion with ſome Wits, as a larded Chick or Partridge. In my younger time I have been delighted with a Ballad for its ſake; and 'twas ten to one but my Muſe and I had ſo ſet up firſt:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:154213:41"/>nay, I had almoſt thought, that Queen <hi>Dido</hi> Sung that way, was ſome ornament to the Pen of <hi>Virgil.</hi> I was then a trifler with the Lute and Fiddle, and perhaps being Muſical, might have been willing that words ſhould have their Tones, Uniſons, Concords, and Diapaſons, in order to a Poetical <hi>Gamuth.</hi> I can tell you, it was ſome years before I could well diſtinguiſh ſound and ſenſe, by turning of a Rhiming word in a Verſe, into as good or a better in Proſe. I thought it too Sacred to come to that touch: I dare now try it by my ſenſe, and not ſcan it altogether by my Ear and Fingers, if I am not overmuch charm'd with ſuch Muſick made by others. I do not therefore exempt my Treble or Baſe, or any Muſe that dares walk in Bells inſtead of Buskins: or when I would be merry, muſt I receive a Sock that's ſmooth'd with Greaſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Oyl, and ſo liquor my cheeks with a ſmile accordingly? I cannot ſo far ſubmit to the common places of Wit now in faſhion: but let it go, I have enough to anſwer for what concerns me; on which account, if any ſcold at my Muſe, let her wrangle again as well as ſhe can, ſo I do not aſſiſt her quarrel. I am now going into Proſe, to which it ſeem'd reaſonable, not to commit my ſenſe without ſome Apology.</p>

               <head>Eſtimation.</head>
               <p>IT ſhould be the propriety of Vertue; but I do not find that this Logick fits generally the School of the world; in ſtead of <hi>Soli &amp; ſemper,</hi> it is ſeldom to be found in its true place and predicament. There is nothing that has ſuch an Excentrique to men, or runs ſo byaſſed, as their eſteem: He that makes not the world his Friend, (or Bawd) will have little Trade for his merit; and that is the reaſon that ſome ſet up for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo plauſibly. One would wonder how they came, where we find them; had not Fame an Art to go forward with men, though ſhe place her Trumpet the wrong way: there is wind enough in the world to ſerve her turn, and ſhe employes it accordingly. How many have I known that have gain'd repute of Wit, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, good Nature, Honeſty, (marry, and carry it too with a face accordingly) when the contrary of theſe has been their true Character? They can walk with Vertue as our Antipodes do with us, yet ſeem to behold Heaven the ſame way. Others there are that care not how meanly they arrive to eſtimation, ſo they have it: they can Court this man to call them witty, another to call them honeſt; they will ſubmit to cringe,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154213:42"/>and ſneak for it, take it for Alms, or any way; ſo they have their bauble of applauſe, they are ſatisfied. Though the world be liquoriſh enough to ſwallow miſtakes and follies, as being to vulgar apprehenſions welcome Novelties, It is no ſmall grievance to the ingenious and candid, that know how to fit their taſtes better; their diſadvantage only is, that the undeſerving will ſtill have moſt followers, whileſt the wiſer and honeſter muſt be contented to bring up a thin rear of merit, as well as they can: However they have this to comfort them, that if they wait long behind, their eſteem will be more elevated whenſoever it takes place. I confeſs, Honour, Riches, Fortune will operate; but we know what heads it makes giddy; gild it how we can, there is no Paganiſm ſo barbarous to reaſon, as the Idol of a Fool.</p>

               <p>I May call it a Jewel, which the Soul of one man depoſites in anothers; and it ſhould be prefer'd with as high a care: whatever its value be, not only the betraying what concerns our repute, or eſtate is a breach; but even the leaſt word or thought is a violation and injury, if
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154213:42"/>charged on our confidence. How contrary is the worlds courſe! Men hardly converſe without well warding of their words, as if it were neceſſary their thoughts ſhould paſs from one another in Armour: no caution is ſufficient to prevent miſtakes, cavils, miſ-reports: our Friends, Viſitants, Servants muſt be ſuſpected, and all little enough too. There is nothing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the Soul of man, than that men live ſo unhappy, as to be diffident of one another; a blemiſh to man's being, that will hardly admit a Cure. We need not truſt all, and we muſt truſt ſome, and be in their power to deceive us too. If there were no Devil, a falſe man does pretty well ſupply his Office, he does all in this world he can wiſh, but damning of us: or may be reſembled to the Plague, againſt which the beſt preſervation is, to be as far off on't, as one can. If he be cunning, he does it more impiouſly, though perhaps more covertly: And yet I have known ſome that have been made up of a ſmall ſtock of impudence, or what ſignifies little more than meer deceit and lying, have made notwithſtanding a pretty good ſhuffle in the world, even with ſuch as might well underſtand them, but will ſuffer themſelves to be miſled. He that ſees ſuch a man in a Nooſe, of which he is able to forewarn himſelf, does leſs deſerve pitty. I would be as far from admitting a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154213:43"/>man to my converſation, as to my friendſhip; in the beſt ſenſe, it were to have too great a familiarity with the worſt, and meaneſt of Vices.

               <p>THe advancement of the Wiſe and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, is the happineſs and glory of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; it is diffuſive with Governments, and ſpreads their greatneſs. Men muſt be under Power, and Laws, and can reaſonably ask no more, than to be honourably governed. But do Princes and States what they can, it will not always be ſo: let them ſhuffle the Cards as well as they may, Fortune will turn up ſometimes her own Trumps; which makes ſome men not more a wonder to the world than themſelves, in their felicity of aſpiring. It was a very remarkable paſſage in a Miniſter of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh of <hi>France,</hi> who finding himſelf beyond his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation great, ſaid, that he would give for an Emblem of his Elevation, his Figure ſtanding
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:154213:43"/>on Fortunes Wheel. The King underſtanding his conceit (and whether diſpleaſed with the Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or reſolv'd to remove him) reply'd, that he had beſt faſten the wheel he talk'd on with a ſtrong pegg, leſt it kept turning; which he ſoon proved by his enſuing fall. There is a circling downward, though moſt unexpected, by thoſe that would only conſider themſelves in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of their greatneſs, forgetting that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent may be as near their height, as their firſt riſing was to their Zenith. A Semicircle on the Globe does ſufficiently reſemble it, though half a dayes journey of the Sun. <hi>Cicero</hi> relates of <hi>Marias</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> that he was one of the moſt fortunate of men whil'ſt great, and in adverſity no leſs to be admired; upon which occaſion he adds a little after this excellent precept, <hi>Nemo non poteſt beatiſſimum eſſe, qui eſt totus aptus ex ſeſe, quique in ſe uno ſua ponit omnia;</hi> but he that depends upon the will of man, or Fortune, muſt expect, or at leaſt ſhould be content with their varieties: A thought that is too great a ſtranger to the ambitious. The Pſalmiſt ſayes, <hi>That man being in honour, has no underſtanding,</hi> (I ſuppoſe meant of its vain inducement that renders him forgetful of what he was, by what he is) a carriage ſo frequent with the world, as if men had reſolved on a ſecret Act of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion relating to their own exaltations, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154213:44"/>neglect of their Friends. How ſcornfully can they behold their paſt Obligers! as if they muſt needs act the Ape, which skipping from bough to bough, turns his tail towards you, when at the top: Or that men were to take notice they were grown now too big for their merit, they may ask and be denyed too; it being ſeldome obſerved, that ſuch as can forget to do hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly of themſelves, will do any thing worthy when they come to be remembred; the Office or Preferment does ſo far alter the ingenuity and worth of their perſons: but how ſcurvily will ſuch behold themſelves in the opinion of men? If they ſlip from their height, or would be beholding to others, (not ſeldom the fate of ſuch Aſcenders) let greatneſs be as well bred as it can be, we may obſerve the Evil manners of Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude too often accompany its aſpiring; it is a Weed that grows too commonly with the proſperity and flowers of a Court, or State, and ſo diffuſive unto meaner conditions of life. <hi>Rome</hi> had it bitterly enough, both the time of her State, and Monarchy, as may be ſeen by many examples: And I judge, that in order to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique affairs, (if at all) it is moſt allowable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſometimes ceaſes, or prevents the ambition of a well-deſerving merit, where if it cannot be ſafely rewarded, there may be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in laying it aſide. How odious muſt this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:154213:44"/>vice be as to every private man, when nothing can palliate it in a Prince, or State, but common preſervation? The Subordinates of power, are very often ſo unneceſſarily infected with this vice, that when they are got high enough, for the moſt part they remove the ſteps and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their preferment to ſome diſgrace if poſſible; as if there could no fair quarter be kept with any, on principles of greatneſs. But let them keep their Stations as well as they can, I am like to continue in mine, I hope with better ſatisfaction, than to depend on any improvement of my condition by their favours. He that aſcends a Hill by a path of Ice, is in ſome danger of a precipitate ſliding backwards, and the moſt perillous when neareſt the top: and ſuch are not ſeldom the lubricities and ruine of greatneſs. It is well hinted by <hi>Seneca</hi> the Tragedian, in this expreſſion, <hi>Quam fragili loco ſtarent ſuperbi!</hi> and in another place he calls it, <hi>Aulae culmine lubrico,</hi> which is ſomewhat more particular. The world is full of quarrelling at preferment, by reaſon more deſire it, than deſerve it: And as merit is ſtill the glory of a few, ſo it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally plac'd in ſuch, who are beſt content with a neglect of their deſervings; men not alwayes to be found in the concourſe and Road of Courts, and conſequently more readily paſs'd over, or left to a ſolitary injoyment of their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:154213:45"/>worth. Though Princes are in reaſon the beſt obſervers of men, (as experiencing the abilities of many by their ſeveral Imployments) yet would they take care to finde out apt and worthy ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, as well as limit their Obſervations to ſuch only within their eye and buſineſs, their affairs might perhaps be no leſs acceptably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged: but this were to make the world too happy, and Monarchs more curious in the choice of their inſtruments, than they judge they have occaſion to be. On the other ſide, there are men that at firſt will ſeem to act nothing but what ſhall deſerve the favour of a popular breath; they will not by any means allow themſelves to do well, without that kind of oſtentation and glory; their merit muſt be ſet to ſhew, if not to Sale: to be good unſeen, is not enough: or rather than fail, they will thruſt themſelves on the world and buſineſs; they will Intrigue, Cabal, create their Partiſans and Factions, until taken off and ſweetned by ſome convenient advancement. Of theſe there are many remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, (and I ſuppoſe none of our beſt Patriots) but the miſchief is, that when they have their ends, they very often render themſelves worſe a contrary way: though when the Vizard is taken off, it is ſome wonder if they be not aſham'd of their own faces. Doubtleſs the moſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable ambition is, to refuſe Ambition; but this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:154213:45"/>is ſuch a Phoenix of worth, as is ſeldome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveable in Mankind. If I were asked whether the Publick does at any time wiſely, in turning the Byaſs that guides the Actions of ſuch to its more regular imploying their abilities, I conceive it may be anſwered affirmatively; not only as it is more gracious and eaſie to win men by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of favours, but that by this means the ſtrength of faction is weakned with more facility, and its Abettors rendred more diſabled, if not deſpicable in the ſenſe of their buſie admirers, than by any ſeverity can be made uſe of; the laſt adding the reputation of ſufferance, whereas the firſt produces a certain neglect, if not their contempt on all ſides. But theſe are Politicks above the ordinary drift of an Eſſay, and ſo we'll leave them. There is a pretty kind of humour obſerveable in many, which is, to be ſure to diſlike or decline their precedent good opinion they had of any, in caſe the publick thinks fit to prefer them to management of things; they muſt then be no longer good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths men, but are immediately cryed down as men loſt, or profitably with-drawn from all publick good whatſoever. This humour I conceive is more to be obſerved in the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than in moſt Nations; as if it were neceſſary to be peeviſh at the Actions of their Prince, or that ſuch he thinks fit to employ, could not be good
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:154213:46"/>in his opinion, and theirs together. But let theſe know, that the ſcattering of ſuch conceptions, can have only growth from the Seminaries of Faction, and ought ſo to be eſteemed, if not otherwiſe puniſhed. Particular men have little more to do with Governments and their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, than to be rul'd by them; at leaſt it is their duty to diſpenſe with their failings. To hear a man, whoſe greateſt knowledge lyes in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of a Fair or Market, undertake to judge capriciouſly of affairs of State; can there be any thing more ridiculous? and yet there is nothing more commonly diſcuſſed, even by the meaneſt apprehenſions. If men were as ſtrictly inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive of the management of their private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, they would leſs partially blame any miſcarriages of the Publick, ſince moſt want due care and conduct in things of particular and ſmall importance. In ſum, what a wiſe man cannot commend in ſuch as are lawfully ſet over him, he will finde his diſcretion and modeſty enough obliged to grant them his pardon.</p>

               <p>DEmonſtrative Science is the glory of Man's Soul, becauſe it, of all other, gives reaſon
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:154213:46"/>the higheſt perfection: and doubtleſs men are moſt Superlatively obliged to Mathematical Arts for ſo elevated and refined an underſtanding; it brings us to the greateſt certainty we can arrive to, both of Sublunary and Celeſtial beings and operations: it has ſo much to do with Heaven, that if any knowledge was moſt immediately given to man from God, it was moſt probably this: It does immaterially, as I may ſay, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and abſtract its operations from things, and yet delivers them no leſs fully to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; which muſt be granted a kinde of Supernatural manner of thought, in no ſmall meaſure applicable to the Divine and Spiritual being of God. Who can but admire that a Point, a Line, a Superficies, ſhould ſo exactly terminate all commenſurable magnitudes, and yet all theſe but meer <hi>Idea</hi>'s or Notions of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; for if they were quantitative, they would be part of what they meaſure, which were very erroneous to admit. <hi>Euclide</hi> asks no more, than a reaſonable condeſcention to the afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Poſtulata's,</hi> to raiſe the admired Structure of his Fifteen Books. I wiſh that all ſupernatural and infallible pretences had as much demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or impos'd no more on the conceſſions of reaſon. Beſides, there is in no ſmall meaſure a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in Mathematical operations: let a man but conſider the exact and wonderful certainty
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:154213:47"/>in the works of Arithmetick, the Rules of Falſe Poſition, the Solutions and Equations of Algebra; which, (from as it were a Supernatural manner of working,) findes without error the truth required: And he will ſoon grant this Science to be more perfect and ſublime, than all other humane knowledge: And I doubt not but it was for this reaſon, that <hi>Plato</hi> was induc'd to believe, that the Harmony and order of the Univerſe, conſiſted chiefly in a Divine diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of number and motion. I could never believe but there was more true ſenſe in <hi>Euclide</hi>'s <hi>Quod erat demonſtrandum,</hi> than is to be found in all the Tearms, Propoſitions, and Syllogiſms that ſtuff up the reaſon of the Schools; becauſe they are ſubject to the fallacy of a Pedant, to whom the other in three words gives Law. As Arithmetick has many Excellencies, ſo Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry has ſomewhat more: wherefore I cannot but commend <hi>Pythagoras</hi> for his making ſo famous an oblation to Heaven, for being ſo divinely inſpired, as to finde out the unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible power of Lines, in a Rectangle Triangle mentioned in the Forty ſeventh Propoſition of the firſt Book of <hi>Euclide;</hi> and perhaps there is not any thing more admirable and uſeful in any Mathematical demonſtration. If this Science does elevate mans knowledge, it does no leſs advance his Wit, in making above all other the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:154213:47"/>fancy Solid and Large. <hi>Virgil</hi> well perceived this, who, more than all Poets was Mathematical Learn'd, as may be ſeen in many parts of him, but moſt eſpecially in his inimitable <hi>Georgicks:</hi> which is enough to ſhew what Ornaments this Science gives to the higheſt productions of Wit. Some things are handled in this Science with ſuch a laboured and needleſs curiouſity, that if done what is required, it ſignifies not much to the practice and advance of this moſt excellent knowledge. Hither might be referred ſome trite and impertinent operations in Algebra. As on the other ſide, that high and noble endeavour of ſquaring the Circle, is very commendable, becauſe were the Demonſtration agreed on, it would furniſh us with means to aſcertain the proportion betwixt a ſtraight and a circular Line, which were exceeding uſeful. And here I cannot but commend the worthy endeavours of Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> who, ſay what his Detractors pleaſe, has come nearer it by a Geometrical way, or <hi>per loca plana,</hi> as Mathematicians ſpeak, than any that have yet attempted it. Beſides the many uſes and perfections appropriate to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Arts, there is not any ſtudy that has added like this, ſo laſting an Honour, even to the greateſt Kings and Emperors: how famous does <hi>Ptolomy</hi> continue with time, for his elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and extraordinary depth in this kinde of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:154213:48"/>Learning! In like manner <hi>Alphonſo</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> had not liv'd at this day ſo memorable, were it not for his Aſtronomical works: not to reckon the many Ancient Philoſophers, with other of late and excellent repute, ſuch as <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus, Regiomontanus, Kepler, Tycho,</hi> who added no ſmall perfection to this excellent Science. I dare affirm, that amongſt the great Acts of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> there is nothing can balance the ever-remaining glory of his recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the annual account; inſomuch that the world at this day is beholding to his care for a more true Computation of time, than was known before: and I conceive that the late <hi>Gregorian</hi> account, is not to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, notwithſtanding ſome undertake to aſſert the contrary. But I need not farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the Encomiums of Mathematical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſince this Science cannot want praiſe, that is of ſuch extraordinary abilities to prove its worth.</p>

               <p>THere are far more that ſeek for praiſe, than really deſerve it: the moſt irregular ſort of men, would have in their kinde an Applauſe,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:154213:48"/>as well as the truely meriting eſteem; Fame being a Miſtreſs that has a rabble of followers, and ſhe debauches them accordingly: ſhe is ſerved by ſo many oppoſite Complexions, that her liſts are endleſs: there are few men ſo reſerved or ſerious, that will not ſhew their Gallantries to this Miſtreſs; or any ſo inconſiderate, or ſtupid, but will get as near as they may, the Van of praiſe; If they cannot own the Honour of merit, they will (rather than be left out) be as eminent as they can for their vice or follies: Thus <hi>Claudius Caeſar,</hi> though a very Beetle-brow'd Emperor, could ſtand upon the honour of a contemptible Triumph; another muſt needs play the Fool, ſo far as to Counterfeit Thunder, that he might be admired as a God on earth. It is well for the vain-glory of ſuch Princes, that they can command and oblige Flatterers, though it be pernicious to their vices, that few dare laugh them out of countenance. What a Fool does, is no wonder, becauſe his actions are the effects of folly: But how idely ſuch as would be thought the Grandees of the world in all capacities, for the moſt part, do carry themſelves in order to their eſteem, deſerves more admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pity: Conſider them on the plauſible account of Wit or Honour, and it is eaſie to obſerve, how fantaſtically they itch after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, or invite it to them. I have known
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:154213:49"/>not a few that would be content to blaze their wit and atchievements, with ſo confident a vanity, either as related by themſelves or others, that it has put a modeſt ſtander by to a bluſh for their ſakes: Nay, this is not enough neither; they muſt have their Partiſans, their Factions, their Defenders, that will undertake to argue all others out of countenance that ſmile at their follies: and indeed ingenuity, and honour (to the ſname of this Age) does not ſeldom deſcend ſo low, as to ſeem beholding in great part to others, for its repute, as if the worth of either was too much doubted to depend on merit alone. We have ſcarce a Poet that dares ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a Play, but he firſt beſpeaks his Cabal, though there be nothing that makes his Wit more ridiculous: nor a man of Honour that can ſafely undertake a Service for his King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, if not beforehand with detraction. I need not mention how much the emulation and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of this kind have, and may redound to our publick detriment. I read of few ancient Worthies that ever made ſuch proviſion for their praiſe, at leaſt, were ſomewhat farther off from giving it themſelves. I only finde <hi>Annibal</hi> once ſo extravagant, and that rather provoked by the diſcourſe and interrogation of <hi>Scipio,</hi> at that ſo famous interview mentioned by Hiſtorians, who asking him whom he thought the greateſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:154213:49"/>he anſwered, <hi>Alexander;</hi> and who next? ſayes <hi>Scipio;</hi> he replyed <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epirus;</hi> being further demanded whom he thought the third beſt, the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> named himſelf: to which the Noble and Magnanimous <hi>Scipio</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, And what wouldſt thou have thought <hi>Annibal,</hi> had'ſt thou overcame me? Why then, ſayes the other, I would have judged my ſelf the beſt. An example very remarkable, ſince <hi>Annibal</hi> got ſo little by praiſing himſelf, that he was forced to beſtow on his modeſt Enemy the moſt Superiour commendation, both in reſpect of himſelf, and thoſe famous Captains he had ſo honourably mentioned. It has been well enough obſerv'd, that few men ever got by ſpeaking of themſelves in any kind; if to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, a man in that caſe teſtifies againſt himſelf; if to praiſe, he ſets himſelf farther back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the opinion of the modeſt and diſcreet: wherefore of all things men ſhould leaſt have to do with their Encomiums, but leave them to the good opinion of the world. A Collateral praiſe does very often advance eſteem; and the more, when it ſeems leaſt particular; wherefore I cannot but admire the pertinent and ſublime Panegyrick that <hi>Juvenal</hi> beſtows on the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the two <hi>Cato's</hi> in theſe few words, <hi>Tertius è coelo cecidit Cato.</hi> He names neither of them, yet does more than advance the eſteem of both,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:154213:50"/>by ſuppoſing that to equal their Excellencies by a third <hi>Cato,</hi> muſt be the immediate act of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But as we have few <hi>Cato</hi>'s in theſe dayes, ſo I believe the moſt of our Fame-mongers are not ſo internally partial to their deſerts, as to expect liek praiſes, if we had Poets no leſs able to give it them than <hi>Juvenal.</hi> Above all, I am moſt aſtoniſhed at ſuch, that for the moſt execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wickedneſſes would aſpire to be regiſtred by Fame. We may remember that <hi>Scot</hi> was bold enough to pretend as highly, even for the horrid Murder of the late King; and I judge the like of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Trayterous Uſurpation: But how ſuch men ſhould hope to be of propitious repute with poſterity, when beheld ſo ſowrely by their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, may be enrolled amongſt the Vanities and Impieties of the wicked: Or perhaps it is the policy of ſuch (who having no better way to credit their Villanies) will give them a kind of confident glory, or unrelentancy of their fact, as was obſerved in moſt of thoſe that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for the late King's death. Aſſuredly there is nothing more ridiculous, than for ill men to expect future renown: a preſent hand of power may ſomewhat curb the freedom of Tongues; but in after-time, they will requite their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by exclaiming loud enough. He muſt be very impudent that would not bluſh, if now charged for giving a Panegyrick to <hi>Oliver</hi> in his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:154213:50"/>Throne of Tyranny. So ſoon fade the falſe eſteem, and aſpiring Bayes of the Impious. Men may endeavour to ſhrow'd or conceal their evil manners, and wickedneſs; but Vice has too broad a face to be masked by their Artifice: there are and will be alwayes men honeſt, and diſ-intereſted, that will diſcover it.

               <head>Criticiſm and Cenſure.</head>
               <p>THe moſt Magiſterial Criticks have not as yet agreed on a certain definition of Wit, and I believe never will; they are content to take it where they finde it, and ſo may any man that looks leſs big on ſenſe than they do: he can give himſelf ſatisfaction, though perhaps with leſs curioſity than the others that take upon them the repute of being Critical. But there are few men that will ask their leave to like their own compoſitions, or what is ingenious in other men; the ſincerity of ſuch, being for the moſt part doubted, that appear rigid or bitter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the performances of others. <hi>Julius Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger,</hi> a ſevere and learned Critick, as may be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:154213:51"/>ſeen by his Cenſure of Poets, requires theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars to compleat a ſtile of wit; that it be, <hi>Terſus, mollis, &amp; rotundus;</hi> as on the other ſide, <hi>durus, humilis, &amp; laxus,</hi> muſt not have his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: and perhaps he is juſt enough there. He allows <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Works only all poſſible perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and calls him no leſs than the God of Poets. <hi>Homer,</hi> though his Predeceſſor, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by many, he charges with many boyiſh and trifling paſſages, inſomuch that he blames ſeverely his Characters wit and conduct. In one place he mentions him with this neglect, <hi>Nolo in preſentia cum</hi> Homeri <hi>puerilibus ineptis ineptire. Horace,</hi> notwithſtanding in many things he highly eſteems him, in other he reprehendeth him to purpoſe, ſhewing his faults by his repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and excurſions from one thing to another; nay, he aſſures us, that in his <hi>De arte Poetica,</hi> he has ſuch failings, as he would correct and amend in other Poets: take his own expreſſion to this purpoſe, of <hi>Horace</hi> in general, <hi>Neque in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyris, neque in Epiſtolis, at ne in Poetica quidem, in qua hoc ipſum precipit, obſervavit.</hi> He had been as tart with <hi>Ovid,</hi> (who was too much a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-like Poet not to have faults) againſt whoſe Writings, I ſuppoſe he could have brought in ſomewhat a larger liſt of exceptions, yet he ſpares him ſomewhat more honourably, thus— <hi>Hoc tamen vetat pudor animos nobiliores, qui
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:154213:51"/>non inſectando, ſed admirando antiquitatem ineunt gratiam à poſteritate.</hi> 'Tis true, that <hi>Ovid</hi> had ask'd his Reader pardon before, by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that he let ſome things paſs that ſtayed no longer with him than <hi>primos habere ſonos;</hi> and I ſuppoſe he had the more eaſily <hi>Scaligers</hi> to boot.</p>
               <p>It were too tedious to recount the ſharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections he has on moſt of all the Ancient Poets: one above all I cannot but mention, and that is of <hi>Perſius,</hi> whom he calls a moroſe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and unintelligible Writer (which I will not deny) nay, ſuch a one as underſtood as little what he writ himſelf, as any man elſe yet <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> muſt needs be ſo ſuper-critically knowing beyond all others, that he ſayes, all thoſe obſcure things of <hi>Perſius</hi> are throughly apprehended by him: <hi>Quanquam nunc à nobis omnia intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntur.</hi> But whether <hi>Scaliger</hi> does not himſelf deſerve a laſh from the Criticks for this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious miſtake of his, I leave them to judge. In the mean time it ſufficiently appears, that ſo great a Maſter of Learning and Wit might diſcover his own failings, as well as other mens; which may inſtruct the cenſorious, though of excellent abilities, to have as much regard to their own ſenſe, as what they conceive deſerves a diſcommendation from their Pens. But how much more ſhould our ſmall ſiz'd Wits and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:154213:52"/>take care of their preſumptuous Deſcants and carpings at mens performances, when they are ſcarcely well vers'd in the common places of Grammer and Senſe? nay, when there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to be abominated by the judicious, than what they call wit, and would ſo father on the world? The Preſs as well as the Stage has enough of their endeavours and applauſes; the latter of which is transformed by theſe new Wits and their Poets into the moſt hideous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe of Scurrility, Bawdery, and Prophaneneſs as can be imaginable, and no leſs an offence to diſcreet and modeſt obſervers. Yet with this ſtuff, they are ready to vye with all former commendable Writers: <hi>Shakeſpear, Beaumont, Fletcher</hi> and <hi>Johnſon,</hi> muſt be nothing with them, though ſuch majeſtick ſtrength of Wit and Judgement is due to their Dramatique Pieces. Of <hi>Johnſon,</hi> I dare affirm that he is yet unparallel'd by the world, and may be ſome ſucceeding Ages: He gave our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue firmneſs, greatneſs, enlarged and improved it, without patching of <hi>French</hi> words to our ſpeech, according to ſome of our modern Pens: inſomuch that I queſtion whether any of the Wit of the Latine Poets be more Terſe and Eloquent in their Tongue, than this great and Learned Poet appears in ours. <hi>Virgil,</hi> who moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly was as well accompliſhed to value
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:154213:52"/>Wit, as any of his Poetical contemporaries or predeceſſors; how candid and handſomely does he occaſionally take notice of moſt of all the Greek Poets? he did not grutch to ſay, <hi>Muſaeum ante omnes;</hi> nay, to the honour of the Muſes, he figures their Divine being in the <hi>Elizium</hi> or other world, as may be ſeen in his Sixth Book of <hi>Aeneids;</hi> and I ſuppoſe, that moſt of our preſent Writers will grant, that he, who ſo far exceeded all Wit that was extant in his time, or that ſince has ſucceeded, could not but in a high meaſure underſtand the value of his own: nor do I finde throughout his Works more than this one line of a Cenſorious or Satyrical reflexion againſt any of his contemporary Poets: and that very gentle and ſparingly, <hi>Qui bavum non odit, amat tua Carmina maevi.</hi> And I believe, there was never any ſo neat and modeſt Satyr, that has ſuch a Compendious, and yet full extent on incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Poets, as this one Verſe of his; which ſhews that he underſtood too well his worth, to endeavour its exaltation by the undervaluing or depreſſing the fame of others: on the other ſide obſerve with what humility he ſpeaks of himſelf comparatively with other Writers that deſerved his eſteem, as in his <hi>Eclog. Meris, Nam neque adhuc varo videor, nec dicere cinna digna, ſed argutos inter ſtrepere anſer olores.</hi> I have been (I confeſs) a little too pedantique in filling
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:154213:53"/>this Eſſay with ſo many quotations: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it of good uſe to many of our Wits and Poets that ſo inconſiderately applaud themſelves, and cenſure others; I thought fit to beſtow it here: and indeed there is no better means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming defects in men, than when it is preſſed by the authority of beſt Examples. A modeſt and judicious Critick is an Honour to the Chair of Wit, and he alone is ſit to claim it; his ſenſe is able to make more perfect the Ingenuity of Writers. <hi>Ovid</hi> has two Verſes which tell us how much he eſteemed ſuch a man; which I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore add, though I have confeſs'd my ſelf too buſie with ſuch kinde of Preſidents already: <hi>Corrigere aſt tanto res eſt magis ardua, quanto major Ariſtarcho magnus Homerus erat.</hi> Here <hi>Ovid</hi> means well, in beſtowing this Panegyrick on a Judgment able to correct; but I could have wiſhed he had named <hi>Homer</hi> for the Compoſer, and <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> for the Judge, ſince the firſt was certainly a better Poet than Critick. I finde it obſerved of our late worthy Writer Mr. <hi>Cowly,</hi> that whenſoever his Judgment was deſired, he was more forward to commend what was well, than to reprove things amiſs; by which means he gave not only Writers incouragement, but incited as much their deſire to amend what he conceived faulty: An example worthy of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in ſuch as take upon them to judge of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:154213:53"/>Wit; in which caſe, there is not ſeldom more to be prais'd, than to be rejected. But we have many of our contemporaries that will make it their malice or mirth to do otherwiſe; nay, will not be contented to diſlike, but they muſt nauſeouſly Character mens perſons on the Stage, ſcatter or otherwiſe publiſh their ſcurrilous reproaches: inſomuch that I have known ſome (and of no ordinary quality) that have more gloryed in a pitiful Lampoon, or Libel, than if they had been able to compoſe a good Poem. But how much more deſpicable do they render their parts by ſuch a mean diſcovery of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than any mans Wit they can pretend to quarrel with, would deſerve a ſerious inſpection of their thoughts. They would then ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how they ought to be valued by the times they live in, and how they can convey nothing ſo permanent to the future, as their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Monuments. Cenſure is ſuch an Itch, that not only green and giddy heads, but men of firm comprehenſions may find ſome imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their Abilities to allay it; there being nothing more generally acceptable to humane Nature, than to be buſie and prying into ſuch defects as might well ſpare them the trouble of a concernment. To conclude, he that is wiſe and moderate, will finde he has ſo much to do to correct himſelf (let it be in Wit or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:154213:54"/>Manners) that he will have little encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to exerciſe his Criticiſms and Cenſure on others.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:154213:54"/>manners to a ſuitable Mediocrity of good: I would not wiſh to go much farther; but I finde that I am able to ſpend more pounds, than wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be at the charge of a few good deeds. I am free to charge my ſelf home enough, though I experience as much the parſimony of vertue in other men: But, be it with them and me as it, may be, I will ſay this for my Theam, that I would chooſe it in all things appertaining to me; I may take leave, I hope, to commend what I cannot improve or practice, as well as other of my Theoretical friends: To touch a ground of vertue, is almoſt the talent of every Pen; but when we come to compoſe handſomly all her parts, the harmony is not much to be admired. I was telling my Reader of ſome ſatisfactions as to a Medium in my condition of life, and now I will tell him in what other particulars I eſteem it beſt. In the firſt place, I like it in years; that is to ſay, neither too young, or too old: if Women cannot approve my choice (for reaſons they are beſt able to diſpute) I would not go ſo far forward with my time, but in complaiſance to them, I would ſet theirs as much backward; my reaſon is this: youth (I conceive) has ſo many rambles, and is ſo unſteady for thought, that a man lives a fool to himſelf; or perhaps comes to an eſtate at One and twenty, that were fitter for him at forty; but my argument is yet
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:154213:55"/>more mannerly, by underſtanding what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to a particular accompliſhment. I mean that alſo of due reſpect to others, which is indeed the greateſt; he that looks for either of theſe from youth, may as well expect that a Horſe may go away with him in a ſmooth Amble as ſoon as back't. 'Tis well, if we have not as much oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to learn at Forty as at Fifteen; I ſuppoſe many finde it no contradiction: it is a task vain enough to tutor man too early; he will ill Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band his Ethicks in ſpite of fate, till time make him more tractable. The beſt that can be ſaid for youth is, that it may ſometimes yield and ply to amendment, where age will not, by reaſon of long continuance and habit. And ſo much for the young. As for Age, I finde I have as little reaſon to hope much good from it, as to truſt youth. If Vice be ſtrong in the bud or growth, it is odds but it will be more rugged and tough when old; as we ſee in Trees, though they be ſhivered and wind-ſhaken by time, they will have the more firmneſs and knots. 'Tis true, Age does decay mans ſtrength, but not alwayes his appetite: He that has been liquoriſh young, 'tis odds but he'll like the ſame ſauce when he is old: the fancy will have its luxury and youth when the ability is leaſt. There are ſome Vices that are not ſo familiar with youth, and will ſix with Age; it is apt to be Moroſe, and encreaſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:154213:55"/>ill nature abundantly: obſerve it but in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, and you'll finde none ſo retentive as the old, though they are juſt taking leave of the world. A prudent man may well fear his living over-long, not only as it enfeebles our bodies, and renders them leſs uſeful to our Selves, our Countrey, and Friends; but as it weakens the faculties of his Soul, and may render him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and froward: we may call Nature too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent, when ſhe permits us to live a Child's life twice: He that out-lives himſelf, does as much ſhame the kindneſs of Providence for giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his life ſo long a thread. Age having ſuch a tincture of the River <hi>Lethe,</hi> that it does ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt an oblivion of our ſelves, in our moſt eſpecial concernments. I have known ſome that have not onely forgot acquired knowledge and letters, but even the common things of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and manners. At this day, I know an ancient man, a near Neighbour of mine, that ask'd about laſt <hi>Michaelmas</hi> whether we ſhould have no <hi>May</hi> that year; he had liv'd to forget the revolution of time, though ſo long his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. I wonder that among the Heroick Acts of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they incouraged no Suicides in Age, ſince they could do it upon accounts of friendſhip, of diſgrace on loſs of a Battel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their Enemy, and the like; when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there is no greater affront to the honour of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:154213:56"/>life in many kindes, than the folly and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Age. Had this been allowable with them, we had perhaps heard of more of their <hi>Heroins</hi> than <hi>Hero</hi>'s. The apprehenſion of the ruine and neglect of paſt beauty, had doubtleſs done much with ſuch objects; and I am glad for their ſakes there was never no ſuch uſage. I cannot but chide with Nature, when I behold a handſom Lady declining or ſuperannuated: I could fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently make it may deſire that the luſters of that Sex might ſtill continue; and I judge all men obliged to do the ſame, by reaſon they chiefly would continue ſuch attractions for mans ſake. If this wiſh be to little purpoſe, I hope they will allow it obliging; and I am over and above paid for the thought. To return to my own Sex, I have commended a mediocrity in years; and I have reaſon, ſince I have prov'd it beſt as to my abilities and inclinations. I thank Heaven I am now ſomewhat paſt it, and yet I finde the ſtrength of my Wit and Judgment as firm as ever, which gives me as much incouragement to hope as well of my Age, as moſt can of theirs. Some defect I finde in my Memory and Hearing, the firſt of which was never good young, and therefore I am not to hope its amendment: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would be underſtood onely to reflect on the failings and imbecilities of youth and Age: There is great honour allowable to both,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:154213:56"/>when aptly capacitated for the improvement of life, he that is young may have a commendable growth toward goodneſs; and he that is old and knowing, is more able to direct and practice it. They are both excellent in their kindes; though a middle ſtate of years does more ſurely temper judgment, and therefore more ſuitable to a wiſe man's wiſh, might he alwayes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſo, or not be longer a ſlave to life, than he can comfort his years with right underſtanding. And here I cannot but mention, that if a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> of man's being be approveable as to eſtate and years, and other requiſites of private life; I hold it no leſs commendable as to the publick or body-politick of man at large, take it in the two Eſſentials of a people, Peace and War: a Moderation in either of theſe cannot but be the beſt temperament of power. To be over-long in peace, does very often enervate a People, or is apt to produce ſuch reſtiffneſs, through the Luxury of Eaſe, Pride, and Riches, that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates them into many pernicious extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, ſuch as were the horrible effects of the long peace preceding our late Civil War. As on the other ſide, to be over-harreſs'd with Arms, or poverty (a moſt infallible conſequence of the Calamities of War) does both create and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then diſcontents and faction; whereas if uſed as moderately exerciſing the ſtrength and vertue
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:154213:57"/>of a people, it redounds not ſeldom to their advantage and glory: but ſuch a temper of State is more happily imagin'd, than eaſily found; it being very hard for a Government exactly to qualifie or proportion to both theſe the humour of a people; beſides which, there are not a few external reſpects of Neighbours and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Nations that muſt go into the ballance. However, my Argument muſt be granted in both caſes this advantage, that what comes neareſt a <hi>Medium,</hi> muſt be allowed the beſt. There is amother Mediocrity (which I cannot but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend) and I aſſure you of the higheſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that is to ſay, in Religion: I confeſs I am afraid of having my brain too much fum'd with Zeal, leſt it grow giddy, turbulent, raſh, and by ſuch miſtakes wicked; (as was the caſe of our late Reformers) or ſo unneceſſarily hot, that I muſt needs engage in Polemick Fiſti-cuffs with Divines in the Schools, or courſe the follies or indifferences of Opinions, till they turn head againſt my Reaſon; or invite it to wrangle about ſuch things they cannot teach me, or I them: I am rather content to be ſo far out of the noiſe of the pit, as I would not willingly hear ſuch Cocks crow, much leſs combate their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. On the other ſide, I would not be ſo blockiſh in my Devotion, that it ſhould need boxing from a Pulpit, or not be able to employ
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:154213:57"/>my contemplation of Heaven, without my Ear be ſo boiſterouſly taught it. I would have my Religion at leaſt as well-manner'd as my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; that is to ſay, civil, and diſcreet. I thank God, I have ſeen a Surplice wore in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and thought it ſuperſtition in neither. I can profit from one in a Coat and Breeches, as well as in a Caſſock: I am apt enough to allow men ſacred, ſo they do not oblige me to receive Oracles from them. I know how to commend my Shoomaker, though I do not altogether tye my ſhooe his way. And as I approve a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in this Supream concern, ſo I would make it my choice in the vertues and moralities of life: For example, in Love and Friendſhip, I cannot but believe that an extream in either, does ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men more uneaſie and unuſeful to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than a moderate, and conſequently a more agreeable relation would produce; there being no capacity of vertue more apt to impair, than what comes neareſt an extreamity; every little miſunderſtanding does make it too nice or piquant to continue its fervour long, as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious enough in ſuch caſes of affection; wherefore I will have ſufficient content, if I am but mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately aſſured of either. I finde that eaſe and plainneſs are very grateful to my diſpoſition in all kinds; to which, as I would proportion my manners, ſo I would do no leſs for my Food,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:154213:58"/>Cloaths, and Converſe. I would not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with too much wit, or want what is enough to embelliſh behaviour. A complemental or finical man ſhould no more be of my ſociety, than a Puppet that moves, makes legs and faces upon a wyer: I have enough of ſuch <hi>Punchinello,</hi>'s and it may be they of me: if they afford me quietly my choice, 'tis all I look for; if not, I muſt tell them that I care as little for the modiſh allowance of their wit, as they can for the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of mine. I uſe no Salt purpoſely to gall their Throats. If my Genius has ſpared enough to ſeaſon theſe Papers fit for my Readers pallat—let him taſte for me; however, I will not be afraid to tell the world what I think beſt: If I have ſtirred up any Spiritual or Temporal Zeal to oppoſe me, I know no better way than to refer them to this Eſſay; where I hope I may be found ſo far in the right, as to occaſion a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate approbation or pardon.</p>

               <head>The Dubitant.</head>
               <p>I Count it no diſrepute to our Religion, that it is doubted by ſome, as well as believed by many, ſince I have not read of any perſwaſion but had as many oppoſers as Defenders. I finde
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:154213:58"/>it the ſame under the Law, as under the Goſpel; and yet the Gentiles and Ethnicks that would have argued down theſe, had as much to do in their diſputes with one another. Doubt ever had, and ever will have ſome fellowſhip with Believers, or will be a near Neighbour to them; and men muſt be content with its company, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they they will or no. There is nothing that can be aſſerted to come ſo immediately from Heaven, as no mixtures of men ſhall accompany it: ſuch as have authority muſt be the deliverers, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of it. God has taken more care of the eſſence of our belief, than of the manner and circumſtances; ſuch he has thought fit to leave to the prudence of our Governours and Teachers; who, as they do not finde it requiſite to impoſe over-much on the wiſe, on the other ſide will alwayes finde enough to entertain, or amaze the weak and ignorant: and it does become their wiſdomes ſo to do, ſince all Worſhips are no leſs compoſed of the knowing, the impertinent, and fooliſh, than Body-politicks are: wherefore ſome ſweetning is allowable alwayes according to mens ſeveral capacities, ſomewhat like that of Poetry in <hi>Hudibras,</hi> one thing for rhime, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſenſe. I know a man that taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to admire Prophecies, and of all Books of the Prophets, the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> as they are Sung in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> cited this paſſage, <hi>From Turk
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:154213:59"/>and Pope, Good Lord deliver us;</hi> without which he acknowledged that he had never been ſo ſully confirmed how great a Prophet <hi>David</hi> was: the man meant well, and as little thought that <hi>Hopkins</hi> had ſung this inſpiration inſtead of <hi>David;</hi> and yet I undertake not abſolutely to blame the addition; it was perhaps thought neceſſary at that time to make the Pope and Turk equally terrible, by the authority of a Prophet. Vulgar apprehenſions will be apt to receive impoſſibilities or contradictions; as the glittering of Copper-lace can ſet forth a Stage well enough to them: If a Gold or Silver Sute enter now and then between the Acts, they do not much more admire it. The brain of man muſt be pleaſed with inequalities: as the weak are generally the moſt eaſie, and conſequently the firmeſt believers; ſo the ſtrong in conception will for the moſt part be as diffident. Wit will be ever inquiſitive; and as it is a gift of Heaven, ſo it does require as high convictions, or it has a Pike againſt its will.</p>
               <p>And yet I never knew, and I believe there was never any man that was purpoſely a doubter: they that know moſt, would be glad of all others to be as throughly ſatisfied of what they are to receive. It were very ſevere to conſter ſuch Atheiſtical for endeavouring to inform themſelves, and conſequently would believe if
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:154213:59"/>they could. Ask a vulgar apprehenſion, and he ſhall tell you he believes all he was Chriſten'd to believe; but if you ask him why, he will as ſoon be put to a Nonplus, and tacitely conclude himſelf an Atheiſt: for it is no reaſon or commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of faith, to ſay I believe this or that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I do or will believe it. The Scripture ſayes, <hi>The Fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God,</hi> or as emphatically in ſuch a weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his belief: I am ſure there was never any underſtanding man within this predicament of folly, ſince he muſt needs be better able to inform himſelf, than to believe nothing. God is too plainly manifeſted to ſuch a capacity; he may doubt of his way to Heaven, but he can never controvert his being religious or good: though a judicious perſon may find as much impulſion from his reaſon in ſome reſpects to be a dubitant, as a Fool is unable rationally to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Let Zealots then define which of theſe complexions does conduce moſt to Atheiſm: or to deliver mine, I am confident that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly and irregular carriage of Sectaries does occaſion a greater ſcandal and doubt in this age of belief, than any ſort of men whatſoever; becauſe whatſoever is ſo extravagantly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, muſt in the end produce contempt and disbelief. I neither believe all, nor doubt all; what I finde my reaſon cannot ſwallow, I cannot
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:154213:60"/>perfectly diſgeſt; if I put ſpurs to it, and I finde it will not go forward, I am forced to ſtand ſtill in ſpite of my teeth: However, I can diſpenſe with what I cannot believe, and that as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Chriſtian, that is to ſay, modeſtly and peaceably. If I obſerve any that can ſwallow Burs as eaſily as Pills of Butter, I allow their practice; nay, I commend it, and am ſorry I cannot do as much for my belief as they do: Above all things, I am careful not to offend or trouble the repoſe of other mens Conſciences; I can keep my perſwaſions to my ſelf, and I am as willing they ſhould not be moleſted in theirs.</p>
               <p>There is no queſtion but very many things are to be credited upon the authority of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, of Tutors, of Magiſtrates, in order to the better mannagement and improving of civil ſociety; and it is as undeniable, that many things are worthy of reception, that neither the propoſer can prove or demonſtrate to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, by reaſon that there is too long a train of things to arrive in all points fully to their original verity: wherefore I may doubt, yet not poſitively deny, what neither I, nor any other man that believes them, can aſſuredly evidence. How any one individual thing was firſt produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, I have no certainty; yet I am aſſured it was by Creation, or a work as miraculous to humane conception: The main queſtion is, what
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:154213:60"/>is within the power of a deliverer, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive too nice a thought to be diſcuſſed here. To be plain, I would have as little Sceptical in the practice of Religion as poſſible. He that keeps his thought without conteſting, hinders no body; to which purpoſe, I would be very glad that ſome power amongſt us were eſteem'd very neer, or equal to infallibility: I finde its conveniency amongſt the <hi>Romanists,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it, though I could wiſh their Conſciences were a little more ſubject to a divine juriſdiction here: I think it ſomewhat too much to have any part of my Conſcience at the Devotion of a Forraign intereſt, becauſe it muſt needs claſh 01 with our Laws, and impede ſomething of the eſteem that we ought to have to the eſtabliſhed capacities of the civil Magiſtrate: If he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to be my Judge, I may tacitely chooſe whether I'll believe him or no; but I have at leaſt an unmannerly Religion, if I will needs openly and avowedly go further. I aſſure my Reader, that I ſhould be loath to embrace a better than theirs on ſuch terms, and ſhould think I had a good Conſcience on my ſide to confirm me: Nor can I judge him wiſe, that will ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly or over-curiouſly go far to Market, when he may be ſupplyed as conveniently at home. What our Anceſtors did formerly, is not the Queſtion; the Laws did not prohibit them,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:154213:61"/>which forbid us now. I cannot ſquare my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in ſome things, though Divines on all ſides ſhould undertake to perſwade me; I have too prevalent an apprehenſion of their being ſwayed with intereſt and Hierarchy, to truſt them abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely when either is in Queſtion: I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a ſacred eſteem to be their due, becauſe there ought to be no leſs allow'd to Divine Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. I am ſo far from repining at their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Eſtates or greatneſs, that I judge both for reſpect and order ſake, that they ought not to be impaired in either: I am ſorry if they cannot cure their own Diſtempers, as well as other mens; like Phyſitians that are ſometimes ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, as to leave Diſeaſes worſe than they found them: Did not the modeſty of my Faith oblige my averſion to Faction and Schiſm, my reaſon would do as much for my Conſcience by condemning them as monſtrous and inconſiſtent with humane being, ſince ſeldome or never intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced without Rapine, Blood, and Rebellion, or ſuch a pernicious Licenſe that is greedily ſuck'd in by vulgar minds: and it is ſome Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe to expect a good cauſe from bad effects. If any advantage can proceed out of ſo much evil, it is, that zeal will not probably amongſt us have too much of future reputation; and it is ever ſafeſt that what has ſo commanding a power, if not faſcination on the hearts of men,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:154213:61"/>ſhould prudently be doubted; as it is for the moſt part Hypocritical and falſe. A flame (though counterfeited to come from Heaven) is enough to ſtrike the Soul with fury and blindneſs; an over-hot zeal will at leaſt tend to frenzy, if not to miſchief, as has been a lamentable experience. It is never ſafe to put Religion out of repute, leſt it be not afterwards ſo ſoberly eſteemed as it had been before: Wherefore the ſad diviſions and miſchiefs produced by our late unhappy Civil War, have abundance of my pitty; nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more deplorable, than to ſee the Sword of the Spirit drawn on all ſides with the Temporal. I muſt farther add, that I do not believe any have ſo much occaſioned heſitations and doubts in matters of Religion, as their unfortunate miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages or evil Tenents: few men will be fool'd with the firſt: Ill examples are far more obvious to all underſtandings than diſputable. The Orthodox, and true Proteſtant party, I know are not to be blam'd, though the others have done enough to ſcandal themſelves, and theſe too. Was ever ſuch impieties committed, as that Fanatick tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> have acted? did they not preach up Blood and Rebellion? did they not Sequeſter, Impriſon, and intrude into one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers preferments? Can any man conceive that theſe men did believe at all, or fit to convince any body of a contrary perſwaſion, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:154213:62"/>thus? If ſuch as ſhould be our guides are apt to take wrong pathes, they will be miſtruſted by thoſe they bid follow. They have left their ſtains in too deep a dye, to be eaſily rub'd off, and have nothing but the illiterate madneſs of their Sects to ſupport their impieties.</p>
               <p>There are another ſort of raſh and giddy men, (though I conceive not ſo pernicious to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick as the laſt) and thoſe are ſuch as will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly glory, not only in being Scandals to Religion, but as they will debaſe and prophane the very eſſentials of it in their uſual Ralleries: they will not be ſo humble as to be Dubitants; it is below their wit, if they make not all Belief whatſoever ſo ridiculous, as to be their Comedy and ſport. I need not put my ſelf to the trouble of farther deſcribing them; they are too noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly known without it: wherefore I paſs them by as the worſt Errata's in humane Society. To conclude of this ſubject, let men obey the Laws, the Church, their Prince; and where their Reaſon is too much refin'd, let them endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to allay it, or acquire ſo much becoming modeſty as to enjoy it with ſilence: Beſides, he that is wiſe, will give himſelf caution of being too much an Opiniator, or Singular in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, leſt he prove as great a wonder to himſelf, as he muſt be to the world.</p>

               <p>I Have ever thought time more precious, than to beſtow much of it on many words, or many Authors: the quinteſſence of two or three well extracted, is enough to refreſh or inform our knowledge on any one Subject. On the other ſide, there are ſome that conceive they can never turn over Books enough, though their colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from them are not to much more purpoſe than if they knew only their names; nay, the reputation of which alone, or having of a great Library, has emboldned ſome to enter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Learned: though you finde them in thoſe Liſts, you may ſoon prove them Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, without going ſo high as a School-diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. They will tell you who is an excellent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, Hiſtorian, Orator, or Poet, ſo you'll not have an account of their wit. Every man that has Money can purchaſe Cloaths, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the uſeful demeanor, and carriage in wearing them. I have known ſome heads ſo elaborately ſtuffed with Books, that they have appeared dull, or in a manner ſtupified, as to all polite converſe: if you do not talk with them of what other men have written, you had as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:154213:63"/>good hold your peace; and indeed they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie no more under the weight of ſo many Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, to the improving or ſupportance of Science, than the fiction of <hi>Atlas</hi> does, whom the Poets will needs feign (perhaps from ſuch an extraordinary burthen of his brain) to uphold the <hi>Axis</hi> of Heaven: but I would rather liken them to crouching Antiques of Wood or Stone, which though ſeeming to labour exceedingly under the weight of a great building, yet ſignifie nothing to its ſtrength or beauty. 'Tis an odd, and fruitleſs thing to burthen our brain with other mens works, and produce nothing inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly of our own, or by their means to ride a mans parts to a heavineſs or ſtand. I have known ſome Scholars that would weary or tyre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a Horſe, which a Gentleman could with grace and pleaſure ride a longer Journey. Nature muſt refine our converſe and ſtudies, or they will be unpleaſant or lubberiſh for our uſe: wherefore I had rather have one tenth part of Learning joyn'd to the ordinary behaviour and embelliſhments of a Gentleman, than what a whole Colledge of Students can pretend to from the Schools in groſs. I would be able to put on my Band, ſit my Horſe, or ſpeak handſomely without the aſſiſtance of an Author.</p>
               <p>When all is done, every man ſhould endevour as far as his abilities extend, to be an Author to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:154213:63"/>himſelf, I mean, in well weighing, improving, and as much as in him lyes, perfecting his own thoughts, and next compare them with what he has read; there being nothing more certain, than that the Ingenious apprehenſion of very many men does compleat more uſeful, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowledge than they ſeek, or can be acquir'd from Studies: wherefore he is an ill husband of his brain, that does not manure it aſwel as he can for his own uſe. And as I approve thinking, ſo I ſomewhat more commend the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our thoughts in Writing; not that I judge every man is fit, or would oblige any to undertake publickly to be Authors (except they ſhall judge their parts ſuitable,) but I mean as moſt directive to every mans particular Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, and by which a man is moſt compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and at hand furniſhed with his concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. There is nothing more commendable, than what does enable a man dexterouſly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs himſelf; and no way to do it ſo well as by Writing himſelf: if his thoughts be ingenious, they are collected and improved by it; if not, it is a ready way to be acquainted with his defects, and to amend them; beſides that it advantages exceedingly our Native language, which can no way ſo readily be better'd, as by a frequent and correct uſe of our ſpeech. I have known ingenious men, that for only the neglect, or being
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:154213:64"/>cautious to publiſh what they have written, have either continued unknown, or not had that early repute from the world, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had been their due: And I doubt not, but if the Writings of ſuch perſons were looked into, there would be found (of this kinde) many worthy pieces of Wit and Learning, which out of modeſty, (or to avoid the hazard of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde or unjuſt Cenſure) they do not think fit to divulge. Of all manner of penning our thoughts, I hold Eſſayes the beſt, not only as it is moſt neat and pithy; but as it comes full, and pertinently home to all concernments of life: beſides, it is the eſſence of thought ſo apply'd, and contracted, that nothing can be more fit for our ſelves and others: to which purpoſe I have endeavour'd in theſe few examples here, and ſome lately publiſhed of the like nature. The greateſt diſcouragement I perceived was, (not only as there are few things held good of this kinde) but as I prov'd it no leſs difficult, than I eſteem'd it pleaſant, there being nothing more hard (perhaps) than to ſcatter an ingenious and comely variation of thought; yet ſo, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely and properly to connect their dependance on one matter, or Argument, which is the buſineſs and beauty of an Eſſay; the uſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhould be as familiar to an ordinary apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as the higheſt of Capacities. Of all the Pens
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:154213:64"/>of the Ancients, I judge that of <hi>Petronius Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter</hi> to be in all kindes the moſt polite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, it being ſo familiarly applicable to the Natures and converſe of men, as is not to be parallel'd by Antiquity: wherefore I cannot raiſe his commendation higher, than to allow him their beſt general Writer, or Eſſayiſt. And with us, I know of none ſo near his parallel as the late Sir <hi>John Suckling,</hi> whoſe wit was every way at his command, proper and uſeful in Verſe and Proſe, equally gentile and pleaſant: And I believe he has not too partial an eſteem and memory, if allow'd the <hi>Petronius</hi> of his Age. Of all Writers in this way, I judge <hi>Montaigne</hi> is moſt taxable, (though I greatly commend his parts) not only as he is very diſagreeable or contradictory to himſelf, but that he is long and tedious, and ravels in a deal of quotations, and things diſorderly and out of place; nay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times takes heads to write on, when you read him ſpeaking to other purpoſes, &amp; things of different nature: For what is more impertinent, than to pretend to write (as he does) of Coach and Horſes, or of ſome Verſes in <hi>Virgil,</hi> and not once touch the Argument he pretends to handle? Which was well perceived by my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> who not only far exceeded him in all reſpects, but has worthily left himſelf the beſt example of an Eſſayiſt throughout the world. The main requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:154213:65"/>to compleat an Author, are, Wit and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; (ſince how perfectly ſoever he collects from others, cannot be called his) the one as an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the other a well diſpoſing and contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his thoughts. It is true, that wit is more rarely found with men than diſcreet reaſon and judgement, ſince a thouſand may be found wiſe and ſolid, to one man of refined notions and ſenſe; and yet ſo wanting to its ſelf, or ſo fatal to ſuch as have it, as there are none more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to cenſure, than the manners and Pens of thoſe eſteemed witty. And thus we obſerve from the Writings of moſt Poets; if you examine their wit, you may perceive it often; but their judgements by no means ſo perſpicuous: the reaſon I conceive is, that their volubility and airyneſs of thought, being ſo much more predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, there is left a narrow part of their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions to a ſolid management of their inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities; but are ſo ſpeciouſly flatter'd or charm'd with a pleaſing (though falſe <hi>Idea</hi> of things) that they not ſeldom elapſe into many Errors, and out of indulgence to their Verſe, neglect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: inſomuch as there is nothing more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in the world, than a Correct or faultleſs Poem; and I dare affirm, that the too frequent uſe of Rhime does not a little conduce to this misfortune; it being very obvious with ſuch, to take a ſound or noiſe in ſtead of proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:154213:65"/>or ſenſe: As on the other ſide it is manifeſt, that the cleerneſs and ſtrength of a Genius (in all kindes) is not ſo perceptible as when writ without it. Perhaps my Reader will admire that I, who have dealt with the Muſes here and elſewhere, ſhould prepare him ſo ſtrongly againſt my ſelf: but he is to know, that as I grant ſo many failings in other men, ſo I will not defend what are mine: and I ſuppoſe he will be the more inclinable to pardon what he thinks amiſs, ſince I ſo little beſpeak his praiſe. The moſt proper commendation that can be allow'd good Poeſie, is, that it does ſurpriſe and preſent us as it were with new conceptions and wit; from which excellency, I ſuppoſe it was anciently honour'd with the name of Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And it is moſt certain, the more perfect and ſingular any thing appears writ in this way, it will continue many Ages as conſpicuous to the world. I cannot at this day read an <hi>Eclog</hi> of <hi>Virgils,</hi> (not to mention his greater works) but it ſeems to me not onely exceeding delightful, but the moſt perfect and neweſt wit, that the attempts of near ſeventeen Ages ſince him has yet produced; and is as likely to continue ſo ſtill, for the reaſon before expreſſed. As an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſhould be apt and judicious, ſo he ought to be no leſs perſpicuous. A man may write any thing myſtically or hard, nay trifles, as ſubtilly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:154213:66"/>as Metaphyſicks; as I have known ſome Learned that would be ſure to do them curiouſly enough; but they forget that a Reader is not obliged, nor ought he to ſtudy any thing that is delivered knotty, and obſcurely; and yet I have obſerved ſome Writers (though in our Tongue they are born to know) that are ſo croſs-grain'd, as one would as ſoon undertake to underſtand the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt place of <hi>Perſius</hi> Satyrs, as unriddle their wit; or as the aforementioned Author ſaid of his Writings, that the time would come, when <hi>Inter ignotu haberentur,</hi> and ſo I'll leave them. To be ſhort, let a Writer endeavour to be plain and judicious, not cloſe his wit in ſuch a ſhell, as no body ſhall care for the kernel; it being unreaſonable to expect that any man ſhould puzzle his Brain with that ſenſe, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves too intricate for the Authors own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>

And it had no leſs of policy in it too: for by contemning the world and riches, they commended that vertue which challenged a vaſt ſhare of both. It was ſometimes yet more honourable with them, as when the brightneſs of their merit was ſpreading too popular, or began to dazle the eyes of the vulgar; on which accounts the prudence of that State took well their withdrawing. Thus it was in the Eminent example of the great <hi>Scipio,</hi> and perhaps one of the braveſt Gentlemen and magnanimous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that State produc'd: Nor was it any wonder, that he (ſo greatly entertained with the memory of his paſt glory) could pronounce that ſo noted expreſſion of his Solitude, <hi>Nunquam minus ſolus, quam cum ſolus.</hi> And yet it is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently believed that he no leſs accompanied himſelf with his ingenuity in Writing, than his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:154213:67"/>other greatneſs; as is obſervable from the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that is attributed to him of <hi>Terence</hi>'s Comedies: and doubtleſs there are many things more quaint and gentile in thoſe compoſitions, than are probably to be attributed to a mean <hi>African</hi> or Slave, ſuch as <hi>Terence</hi> is conceived to be. How few Grandees at this day will ſit down thus ſatisfied! they can never be Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious or great enough; talk to them of retirement, they count themſelves ruined or neglected; they will rather confeſs themſelves not Maſters of ſo much ingenuity or vertue, that is worth retiring to. If a man ſhould have adviſed ſome ſome of our late Uſurpers, or that quinteſſence of Villany and Tyranny, <hi>Oliver,</hi> that his timely withdrawing from his unworthy Ambition, had been no leſs honourable, than of merit to his Countrey; how would he have ſnorted or canted at ſuch counſel! perhaps he might have pretended purpoſely to ſeek God, but never to declare he had leave from Heaven to recede from his wicked deſigns or power. Which ſhews us, that good men can be content to take from themſelves, what the bad ſeldom or never will do. Another ſort of men there are, who, becauſe the ends of their Ambitions are defeated, or by reaſon they are not ſo conſiderable and publick in affairs, as they would be thought worthy to be, will ſneak to a pitiful kind of Solitude, or
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:154213:67"/>where they may more freely vent their diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; and of theſe, there are not a few exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. As on the other ſide, there are others, who out of a Cynical nature, or a glory as it were not to be great, or as they are indeed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe deſpiſers and haters of humane Society, will lurk in their corners, but to be ſure will carry their evil habits and manners with them, (or as <hi>Tiberias</hi> did when he retired from <hi>Rome</hi> to exerciſe more covertly his Debaucheries) and ſeem to avoid the world, but not themſelves; notwithſtanding it is in ſome kinde the greateſt obligation they can do men, to remove out of their way. I have no ſuch pike to the world, as that I deſire to live ſo, as not to partake my enjoyments in it; my nature cannot be eaſily reconciled to the <hi>Horrors</hi> of Solitude. I cannot believe but a due commerce with Mankinde is a very conſiderable duty of life; as alſo that I finde ſufficient cauſe to admire the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and eminent good effects of Providence, that I perceive in the Ornaments and Grandeur of States and Princes; ſo that I fully enough convince my ſelf, that Heaven is not to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced ſo unmannerly or Monkiſhly as ſome imagine. I do not doubt but there are as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime inſtructions to be drawn from Courts, as from the ſtricteſt Cells; nay, poſſibly better, ſince where Man's reaſon is moſt adorned and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:154213:68"/>refined, his Soul muſt receive a conſiderable improvement by it; and doubtleſs a wiſe man ought moſt to value a ſuitable freedom in the practice of his faith and manners, ſince he can be no other way ſo beneficial to himſelf and others. Notwithſtanding, a ſincere and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable retirement whereby to amend and improve our underſtandings and vertue, is highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable: To avoid the noiſe and turbulency of the world the more quietly, and undiſturb'd to look into our ſelves, has been the buſineſs of the moſt diſcreet and eminent of men. It were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to cite Preſidents in this kinde: they have ſufficiently their praiſes from many Writers; <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> two eſpecial Poets, approved it, adding no ſmall glory to their Pens by its commendation: though they were both by the favour of ſo great and munificent an Emperor as <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> contrary to their inclinations, in great part debar'd their ſatisfactions in this kinde; yet they did not ceaſe their eſteem of retirement, as one of the beſt expedients of humane content and happineſs. Had it not been for theſe receſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of life, and a due time of thought imploy'd from thence, Mankinde had never been obliged with ſo many excellent pieces of wit and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. The Philoſophers that made both their contemplation, could in an ordinary Being, Cave, or Cell, deliver their precepts of Learning
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:154213:68"/>and life, aſwel as the Poets did the ſublimity of their wit and inventions. And I have read, that the Grot or Cave, in which <hi>Virgil</hi> compos'd his matchleſs work of <hi>Georgicks,</hi> is at this day to be ſeen at <hi>Naples.</hi> And it is no wonder, if the Muſes have ever beſt communicated their inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities to perſons of temperate and moderate condition of life: Exceſs being a more general retainer on tumults and triumphs, than on the eaſe and freedom of thought. Whatſoever a mans condition is, he would at ſometimes enjoy a liberty and quiet, to conſider himſelf and his affairs: it has been acceptable and uſeful to the greateſt of Courts and Camps, and all conditions of life, both in order to publick and private concerns.</p>
               <p>In ſum, he that has oſtentation or vanity to be too much known to the world, is in great danger of dying unacquainted with himſelf.</p>

They will pretend to ſtrict intrigues of friendſhip, and for the moſt part more propenſely than deſired; but ſo, as they will ever look aſquint toward their ends, which never fail to diſcover ſuch. If a man have a friendly hope to be any wayes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by them, he is ſure to be fruſtrated, by reaſon they are ſo much beforehand in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign on him.

The pretences of Zeal have ſo regalio'd with the fury and luxury of this Age, that good men might well hope its impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in the next, did not the world produce ſo many bables of extravagancie and folly, as are ſtill too propenſe to ſupport and continue its allurements and deceits.

In the mean time, I will believe that what they ſeem to hunt after, is not worth find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Vulgar zeal keeps beſt quarter with Heaven and Men, when the Sullow is more in their hand than head. If their brain goes to Plough with Religion, inſtead of the grain and bloſſoms of faith, you will have for the moſt part weeds. Wherefore wiſe men might be glad if ſuch would manure their capacities more ſparingly in ſuch matters. I do not conceive that when they ſeem to lye cold or barren, that it is the worſt Husbandry of Religion: Nor do I judge that thoſe Ages of our Anceſtors, which are called heavy, ſuperſtitious, or darker times, deſerve the denomination. One may go to Blinde-man-Buff by day-light, as well as by Candle: an over-heat in the exerciſe of Religion, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſooner tire and weary its profeſſors, than a temperate and calm devotion. I hope I may take leave to commend charity and good manners, without being thought a Bigot of Popery: if there were as wiſe and peaceable men in thoſe

I am well ſatisfied that the ſupream duties of life are more conſiſtent with an humble belief and practice, than in ſuch, who being inquiſitive or turbulent, will take upon them to direct themſelves. It muſt be a weak or fooliſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that is not ſomewhat above ordinary capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, which would render it too ſimple to be ſafe: Wherefore, if Papiſts can be thus convinced in order to their obedience and quiet, I am ſorry that as commendable practice and reaſon is not as eſſential to the faith of Proteſtants; However, I ſhall not ask pardon for my opinion of ſuch as think otherwiſe. As publick diſturbances from Zeal does ſeldom want Patriots, ſo the notions of aſſerting publick good and politick preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, are never without ſeduced maintainers and admirers; the vulgar being alwayes ready to be allured by a ſeeming care of preſerving or better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their common conceruments, though there be nothing at bottom but the utility of their Seducers. It is one of the oldeſt cheats in the world, and will be ever one of the neweſt: 'tis but putting on new trimming to an old dreſs, and the work is done.

We meet it thus in our converſe, our dealings, and in what is called our friendſhip; how few are there that do not ſoon appear bad enough to diſcover themſelves? men cannot enter a familiarity or friendſhip, but they as ſoon come to a diſtance or ſtrangeneſs with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: we may have enough of ſuch as will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily call themſelves our Friends, but are never extended further than the name. I have known a long acquaintance produce worſe effects of this kinde, than a ſhorter familiarity: by the firſt, if men are bad, they are more familiarly knowing of the diſpoſition they are to work on, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſucceed more perniciouſly: wherefore it is good judgement to be rid of ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance betimes, or on a ſmall diſcovery, left you do it after on worſe terms: He that is at any time evil, it is very dangerous to give him opportunity to be worſe: we may well diſcharge the intimacies of ſuch, who put themſelves away, by firſt meriting our ſeparation from them. There is no ingratitude but wears firſt the ſmooth diſguiſe of friendſhip; it being ever referred to ſome precedent endearments by familiarity or obligation, to which purpoſe the excellent Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyriſt <hi>Juvenal</hi> gives us this caution, <hi>Ingratos ante omnia pone ſodales.</hi> Where we entruſt our ſelves moſt, the unworthy Nature of man is more impowred to do miſchief; wherefore
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:154213:72"/>there ought to be no leſs caution uſed to whom we commit the fidelity and openneſs of our hearts, leſt we have a falſe one in return: It being good prudence to doubt moſt, and truſt few; not believing but the denomination and truſt of a friend, are ſometimes the pretexts and ſtratagems of a baſe Enemy. I finde it the moſt general and vehement complaint of Writers in all times I have read of, to reflect moſt ſeverely on the evil manners of their Age; and I judge they have reaſon, as being moſt the concern of men to conceive their preſent defects and vices worſe than ſuch preceded them. And yet I am ſatisfied enough, that there have been times as exquiſitely bad as ours can be pretended to be. The Art of deceit and lying, I finde ſomewhat ancienter than the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe, and the Poets <hi>Sinon;</hi> notwithſtanding the pretended inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and ſanctimony of his Character: but the miſchief is, that what they render'd moſt odious, we frequently practiſe to be more cuſtomary and curious in it. If I were asked whether I would have truſted a Porter or Groom belonging to our Anceſtors, before ſome magnifyed honour, and <hi>Heroes</hi> of this Age; I ſhould take leave, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking many of their pardons, to grant the affirmative. I cannot admire a modiſh trick or deceit, though delivered by the moſt ſplendid Tongue, or Name. Where the Heart has cauſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:154213:72"/>to be aſhamed, there is great reaſon to bluſh for our words: However, we are ſomewhat behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the practiſes of our time, in that a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity or ſmall degree of vertue is able to paſs ſo well amongſt us, whereas a ſtricter Age would be more incompatible in teaching us to be good.

               <p>I Will joyn theſe together, becauſe they are conſidered more than they ought aſunder; they are too familiarly acquainted, to be ſet at diſtance; and are but the common and evident revolutions of Nature, which gets as much by Death, as ſhe can do by Life: if one thing dye, another lives out on't, is too much a common place of Philoſophy to be inſiſted on; I will therefore deal here with their effects or ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: though we cannot live after death the ſame, I finde we dye much after the ſame rate we liv'd: the uſe of life, is but to inſtruct death; and as we manage the firſt, ſo we for the moſt part conclude with the other. If our firſt acts
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:154213:73"/>are good, there is ſome hope of a better at laſt; if not, the contrary; and thus very generally we leave the world. The cure of the Soul when we are to dye, is not leſs difficult than the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Body: To quit a Diſeaſe that has been long upon us, is not eaſily done in a few moments: A long Journey is troubleſome to provide for in too ſhort a warning; the very haſte does enforce us to leave ſomething neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary behinde us. Wherefore might I have my wiſh, I would dye timely and by degrees; and I am no leſs beholding to Nature, if my end be ſo ſitted, that I be not precipitately thruſt out of the world by death; either as it reſpects Youth or Age, I cannot but pity it whereſoever I obſerve it. I would be ſome time a conſuming, and by parts, before I do it altogether: I hold it the moſt familiar way of Nature ſo to diſpoſe of us; and I would not have her purpoſely go out of her way for me: wherefore I am much more deſirous to go off with a Conſumption than a Feaver; the firſt as a convenient warning of my diſſolution, which it prepares in part beforehand; whereas the other has too much of heat and Diſtemper. Inever affected Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and I ſhould be loath to have any thing like its humour in my Brain dying. I much approve a handſome correſpondency of Life and Death; I would not be altogether the ſame dying and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:154213:73"/>living; yet not ſo as to attempt a Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis of my conſtitution at the time I am to be transformed by Nature: If I have lived a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, I ſhould be loath to turn a Cynick or Capuchine near the minute of my departure: if I cannot more mannerly take leave of my ſelf in leaving of the world, I ſhall not endeavour at that time to court Heaven moroſely, and in a form would not have becom'd me before. Beſides, it ſhews too much forgetfulneſs, apprehenſion, or deſpair, to put on a diſguiſe, or abſolutely to perſonate another Character ſo near our End. A good man has a hard part to Act Living and Dying; but I would not expect ſuch a ſtrict Decorum in the laſt, that like a Player's, it muſt needs have an <hi>Exit</hi> in the greateſt word or thing: our Wit and Memory are generally too frail (eſpecially at that time) for extraordinary heights: if a mans laſt day be not much the worſt, he ought not to be ſo extraordinary ambitious, as by its means to aſpire to his beſt. I cannot but obſerve too many Auſterities, Surges, and windings in the <hi>Avenues</hi> of Chriſtian practice; one while poſting over the <hi>Alps</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time whip'd and ſpur'd to <hi>Geneva,</hi> as if Faith muſt gad out of our own Countrey of neceſſity: beſides, we are not ſeldom too remiſs, and again as rigorous in our devotions. Wherefore I could wiſh our manners and piety were more ſmooth
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:154213:74"/>and facile, which were both Ethical and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and not as if we had not ſo much to do for our ſelves, as others for us. If this excellency be admired in moſt of the Ancient Philoſophers, it does no leſs highly merit an eſteem; whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts were equally familiar and complaiſant to good manners and belief; and by conſequence could guide themſelves accordingly. If there were here and there a <hi>Diogenes</hi> amongſt them, a Moroſe or Cynical Chriſtian may look as odly amongſt us: I would neither chooſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of a Tub, or a Temple: ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and irregular examples of Living and Dying take me not: auſterity and ſullenneſs may be as much (in its kinde) a form or mode, as capping of the Hat, or cringing the Knee: it is one thing to retire wiſely (as I have inſtanc'd already) and another to be ſo dogged as to bite our ſelves. I cannot blame any thing ſo much in the Heroick vertue and conſtancy of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as their voluntary Deaths and Suicides; as if they were obliged to live no longer than they thought fit themſelves, or when their vertue was not ſucceſsful or practicable with others, or that of neceſſity they muſt dye when other men would not be good with them. I had as live fee a Childe cry for what he has loſt, as hear of an Heroick that kills himſelf for loſing that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep, (the firſt I am ſure is more natural) and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:154213:74"/>this was the caſe of <hi>Cato, Brutus,</hi> and the like. What a Tragedy is it to think of <hi>Cato</hi>'s dying and tearing his Bowels in ſuch a diſpleaſure with the world; or, what was more odious to his ſeverity, the ſight of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and his good fortune, or <hi>Vultum Tyrannidis,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> calls it.

               <p>Which I judge to be ſome overſight in ſo great a man, in expecting a certain Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of vertue over the miſtakes and accidents of the world, when very often nothing ſhifts for its ſelf worſe, or is more often oppreſs'd than a righteous Cauſe. Amongſt all I have read on, I cannot finde a more vertuous Prince, or a juſter quarrel, than what our late King defended; and yet the ſucceſs was no leſs deplorable: As on the other ſide, his magnanimous and equal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the laſt and worſt Exigents of his fate, had been as much an example even to <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> as it far ſurpaſſes all Moral or Chriſtian <hi>Heroes.</hi>

               <p>But to return, I do not finde any thing ſo commendable in the Ancients (putting aſide ſome auſtere examples) as their conſtancy to themſelves and vertues, I mean in beginning betime, and no leſs honourable and prudent in concluding their lives: They did not ſet their youth forward in the world with airy and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick notions, but made their vertue ſerious and early: they did not deny it the moſt weighty imployments of Age, when it flouriſhed with ſuitable endowments; as was ſeen in <hi>Scipio Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican,</hi> who at four and twenty years old, was thought ſufficient for the Prudence and Majeſty of a Conſul or General, and no leſs ſucceſsfully managed the War againſt their moſt ſubtile and formidable Enemy <hi>Annibal:</hi> and it was not to be wondred at with them, whoſe manners did accuſtome and ripen ſo ſoon their greatneſs in all kindes. Amongſt us (as well as ſome Ages paſt) it is far otherwiſe, our brain has no room for flowers early: if we kill ſome weeds at forty, and be reform'd to ſome ſobriety of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and manners then, 'tis paſſable enough with us; nay, if we come to be better acquainted with piety in a fit of ſickneſs, or take faſt hold of our Creed dying, 'tis pretty well.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:154213:75"/>that is, when we are moſt willing, and beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. <hi>Seneca</hi> the Tragedian has it thus:</p>

In ſhort, when we have ſum'd all the Actions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of life, they do at moſt, but either fill us, or weary us, which a very few hours can do as well as many; nay, if we conſider diligently, the greateſt bleſſings we can perceive or enjoy, they are upon the matter but ſo many repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as much ours in one day as in many; we are not likely to obſerve a different order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture either in our ſelves, or any thing elſe. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth were the ſame in our fore-fathers time, and are likely to continue ſo after us; and it is no ſmall meanneſs of Soul, not to have enough of the ſame thing often, which we cannot better underſtand, or any wayes more perfectly enjoy. When all is done, it muſt be (as I have touched already) an evenneſs in living, that can beſt ſuit and welcome our ſeparation from the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:154213:76"/>world: He that has liv'd airily and generous, goes off with no good Decorum, if his death repreſent a Satyr or Tragedy againſt his paſt life: Nor do I judge that Heaven is much pleas'd to behold us ſo unequally: wherefore if ſuch a man does not dye capping of Verſes, I can allow him ſome complaiſance with Poetry and Wit; and perhaps a thought of that kinde, ſo it be uſeful and Divine, may go more ſmoothly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from his Genius, than a line of the Prophets he has not been ſo well acquainted with. He that thinks he can more agreeably end with Muſick than Tears, it were ſevere to deny him, let his profeſſion be what it will. Though I am far of another judgement than <hi>Petronius Arbiter</hi> was; yet I could pardon moſt of his Enormites (except his being no Chriſtian) for his ſo gentile and delicate embracing of his end, in conformity with his life, and what he thought was to be eſteem'd felicity
<q>
                     <l>—Audiebatque referentes levia</l>
                     <l>Carmina, &amp; faciles verſus—</l>
                  </q> And it is probable enough that ſuch as we call Heathen, had a due apprehenſion of the ſhame of too great an inequality or tergiverſation in themſelves; a uſeful thought for Chriſtians, who above all ſhould endeavour to live and dye as becomes their belief.</p>
               <p>I cannot deplore death, (not only as it is ſo familiar and certain with mankinde) but rather
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:154213:76"/>finde my ſelf obliged to welcome it in reſpect of its ſubſerviency to the uſes of Providence; nay, I am aſſured, that had we not our periods ſet by its means, but might live till the world were ſo over-burthen'd, thats its numbers of men muſt neceſſarily be impaired, we ſhould do it but madly and Butcher-like of our ſelves, and be glad to receive the natural conveniencies of death for our own ſakes. I finde (and I do not remember where) a pretty kinde of merry wiſh in ſome-body, that he might never dye; as arguing, that it were nothing for Heaven to exempt from the grave the life of one man. But ſuppoſe this perſon might have obtained his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; might not he have been weary of living, or abhorr'd its perpetuity in himſelf, which to a determin'd and final comprehenſion could not be ſatisfactory? I confeſs I have ſometimes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd how the efficacy of Nature comes ſo eaſily, and in a manner contrary to its intention, to be untimely fruſtrated of life in ſo many ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual things which periſh young: I ſee it in Trees, and Beaſts; and what is moſt deplorable, even in the moſt hopeful of humane youth, when removed by Diſeaſes, Accidents, and the like: and yet there is no doubt but to the utmoſt power and providence of Nature, ſhe intends a due continuation. But this is a contemplation above thought. The moſt proper and uſeful
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:154213:77"/>conſideration that we can have on this ſubject, is, not to be wanting to our ſelves in reflecting on the intemperancies, vices, and imprudencies of life; becauſe theſe are no leſs our concern, than in our power to remedy. As for death, as it is of neceſſity and without us, and claims no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from us that we can call abſolutely ours; ſo we are obliged and ought to be prepared to bid it welcom: There being no greater imbeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of minde, than in being unwilling to leave Life; which we neither can, or ought to keep.</p>

               <head>Of my Self.</head>
               <p>I Have troubled my Reader with ſome genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of my thoughts; and I will now, with his leave, limit ſome to my ſelf; yet ſo, that as much of the world I finde in me, he ſhall take (if he pleaſe) together with me. Every man repreſents a Microcoſm or little world, is old and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial; I finde by my ſelf that I repreſent Mankinde ſomewhat broader and larger. If I conſter my ſelf, I can read the world better with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me, than without me: the manners of moſt men have to do in me whether I will or no; there is no Vice or Luxury but my conſtitution has a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:154213:77"/>twang of, in which my Soul does imbibe more venom than it is able to vomit out of me: nay, I am not aſhamed to confeſs, that I write againſt ſuch enormities that I cannot ſufficiently abhor. There is no Logician of them all, that can better diſtinguiſh Vertue from Vice, than I, though I fail as well as moſt of them, in the general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament of practice: my Soul has the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune (with others) to be more Speculative, than good. I have invented as many fine things for my ſelf, as moſt have done; and I as much blame my ingenuity for troubling me to ſo little purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Repentance is but the brocage of ill manners, though as dear a Purchaſe as any man can make for himſelf: there are many cheaper Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains to be had in <hi>Long-Lane</hi> (if you'll pardon the meanneſs of the Metaphor) than are to be allowed from Philoſophers and Divines: the Soul muſt be at the charge of ſo many nice and fine Idea's, with either of the laſt, that believe me, Senſe will go near to repent, or vitiate her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract another way; wherefore I blame em not, if they allow better bargains to themſelves than other men have from them: I am forced to deal with my Soul and Body together, do what I can, or they for me: What I finde exorbitant in my ſelf, I am as apt to check as another man; yet cannot fall directly foul with Nature for
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:154213:78"/>making Vice predominant, or more neceſſary in me than I could wiſh, ſince ſhe has declared in great part it ſhall be ſo, in giving me a ſuitable temperament and being; I will not therefore be troubled with her will, although I do not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſubmit my own. When I behold a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Woman, my inclinations want no alacrity to conſider her as a Woman, and my ſelf as a Man; nay, I am ready enough to conclude that Nature has intended her as much for my enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as any others, (ſince her Hee's and Shee's have no particular appropriation from any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of hers) untill I ſelect ſome more ſuperlative notions to reſtrain this propenſity of mine. To deal plainly, I finde my appetite ſo ſtrong, or luſty as I may ſay, that I am forced to make uſe of not only a Curb to it, but of a Muſrole or Martingale to boot; and I aſſure you, I am glad when both are ſufficient to ſerve my turn together: If I am able to manage my ſelf ſoft and fairly on betwixt Vertue and Vice, I hold it a good Pilgrimage for my manners: where Nature is irregular, I cannot but go aſtray ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; however, my endeavour ſhall be to break over as few of her Hedges and Pounds, as any other Man. I cannot for my life allow of that general Maxime (from whomſoever it comes) that all men are by Nature equally evil or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſince I finde it as fully contradicted, as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:154213:78"/>the complexions and inclinations of men ariſing from thence can be poſſibly ſaid to differ. It ſignifies to me all one, to hold that men are cold and hot alike, that they feed and are equally nouriſhed to one condition or temperament of Body: which is ſufficient to manifeſt what ado and ſcuffle is made by ſome to fit a more refined Soul and Body together, than is capable of ſubſiſtance from humane life. And here I could make a Query, whether man may not reaſonably expect a ſuitable pardon for ſuch of his offences, as are more properly the impulſions of Nature, than caus'd by himſelf? I finde no way ſo obvious to diſtinguiſh the eſſential dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Soul from the Body, as that I can think or contemplate ſo much better than I do: and here I conceive muſt be granted an Excellence or a Divine comprehenſion in the Soul alone; and yet I finde that it does ſo participate of the imperfections of the body, that it ſeems rather to bungle with thoſe Superlative notions and Idea's that are inherent in it, than to beſtow them fully, and expreſſive on the Intellect. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, I am Writing on this Subject, which I am beholding to my Soul to deliver, but as ſhe conceives it in groſs: if ſhe were able to go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with me, ſhe could declare not only her own being, but as clearly things of a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative excellence; which ſhe being not able to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:154213:79"/>execute, is at ſome ſtand to diſcern her ſelf, as likewiſe her apprehenſion of whatſoever is of a more ſublime ſubſiſtency. Every man may finde that excellency in his Soul, that no reaſon (for the impediments above mentioned) is able to give account of: He may think backward, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, fix his conſideration on this or that object; obſerve ſuch a continual, and uncompell'd mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the faculties of his Soul, as it ſeems neceſſarily to require a more ſupream and laſting abode, than can be given it by the Body: nay, if a man conſiders how far he can recollect paſt thoughts, and how early Children are for the moſt part capable and expreſſive of ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as could not reaſonably be ſuppoſed learn'd, or taught them, it will make a good judgement inclineable to permit the Soul a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pre-exiſtence or being. Wherefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe the Incarnation, (though held by many ſo incomprehenſible a fundamental of our Faith) to be more a Miracle, though a greater, ſince they differ no more, than that the one is the general Divinity of Mankinde; the other a more Supream and Sacred eſſence in the myſtical Union of both Natures in Chriſt. But I will ſay no more of this particular, leſt I make my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders head ake, as well as mine. Every man has enough to do with the world, but I finde that my underſtanding is more intricately troubled
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:154213:79"/>with my ſelf; I am not ſo overſeen or miſtaken in any other man: I know where to have other mens thoughts in greater meaſure by their Actions; as the covetous, fraudulent, diſſemblers, and the like. I act none of theſe parts againſt my ſelf; wherefore they are nothing of my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with me: where my actions are moſt common with the reſt of Mankinde, I finde my thoughts not only different from them, but from ſuch other of mine as my Brain is pleaſed to furniſh me with; I cannot chuſe but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex my ſelf with what I have found is not to be underſtood, as well as ſome I am acquainted withall: I finde my Soul is willing to inſtruct me, but cannot; and yet I am ſtill inviting her to be my Tutreſs: I am ſo unhappy, as never more to doubt my knowledge, than when I conſider much: where I would take it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly, I find it ſhallow; and I prove it the ſame in others that have plung'd deepeſt. I very often perceive my conceptions more jarring within themſelves than with other mens, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am better prepared to receive their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions than my own. I am far more delighted with ſuch Authors as are rather ingenious, than curious and ſubtle; which is no ſmall reaſon that the nice diſtinctions and Doctrines of the Schools, is leſs the Ambition of my knowledge. I have obſerv'd enough the difference amongſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:154213:80"/>Philoſophers of the beſt repute, to build any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Science from principles which at beſt go not much higher than probability: The cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity and ſearch of mans underſtanding I prov'd large; but that Nature had much ſtrained his intelligence in order to himſelf. To Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks I have been more indulgent, in reſpect it depends on demonſtration, and a method to conclude certainly on ſomething: but as I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to proceed, I ſoon found many things in it rather intricate and profound, than uſeful; or as the <hi>French</hi> ſay, <hi>Le Jeun' vau pas le Chandelle:</hi> wherefore I concluded in general, that a taſte of Books, or ſuch a Curſory knowledge as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Gentleman, was moſt advantageous to my Genius. Above all, I found that the wit of manners, ſuch as is in <hi>Cicero, Seneca,</hi> and ſome of the Poets, conduced moſt to refine Nature; giving it ſuch a politeneſs of Spirit and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as was beſt ſuitable to the uſes of life in all kindes: In ſhort, I hold it more agreeable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the world, than to be overmuch cumber'd with its contemplation. I pen nothing of weight, but I finde my conceptions various and incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which not ſeldom betraye my reaſon into a Labyrinth of doubts, and ſo leaves it: though I cannot diſcern the way out, I do not forbear to bring my apprehenſion where I can leaſt guide it; and thus I loſe my ſelf, when I
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:154213:80"/>would be moſt conſiderately found by my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
               <p>I write with as many blots as moſt men do, and yet I have found ſometimes occaſion to blame my ſelf for not making of more: Inſomuch that I have been not a little concerned that I have publiſhed ſome things over-haſtily, or without ſuch a diligent examination as I could have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on them. I would not by my will have enabled the world to judge better of my ſenſe, than my own reaſon might have done for them and me too. <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> ſaid of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Works, that where he made one blot, he wiſh'd he had made a thouſand: If my brethren of <hi>Pernaſſus</hi> be content with me to take as many amongſt us, I will with good ſatisfaction ſhare with them, though I do not finde more of my Lines that deſerve a Purge for being Aguiſh or Gouty, than I do of theirs. As for praiſe, I never much courted it, or thought ſo meanly of my ingenuity, as to endeavour its ſupport that way: where I have thought my lines ſtrong, I have never apprehended they could be Crippled by a Critick. If ſome have ſmil'd at my wit, I have perhaps done the ſame at their cenſure. I could never carry my ſelf ſo ſmoothly towards the perverſe or indiſcreet, as to arrive at the reputation of being one of the ingenious of their Club or Society; which ſeem'd all one to me, as
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:154213:81"/>to be thought one of the wiſeſt Fools amongſt them; though perhaps I might have been cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for ſuch a toy, on as eaſie terms, as I ſee it beſtowed on others, who are well enough content to enjoy a repute of wit, at the coſt of theirs, or other mens folly. I never increaſed my averſion to mens parts, or what I conceiv'd their failings, out of any pique to their perſons, (though it be the Splenative and contemptible carriage of ſome) nay, I have ever endeavour'd to ſet the keeneſt of my Wit againſt my own failings in all kinds; and have been no leſs trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to perceive that ſuch blemiſhes as I have at one time pretty well prun'd from my Genius, ſhould at another ſeaſon ſpring again. I love my ſelf too well to write my own Satyr, and yet I am not aſham'd to tell my Reader that my own Salt has inwardly gall'd my ſelf. I have ſometimes conſidered other men in a balance with me, and have found cauſe to depreſs my ſelf, as much as I have exalted them: where I judged their Abilities weighed lighter than mine, I have added ſome grains to make them more ponderous to my underſtanding. If I have allowed any more favour than they have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or returned me, I repent it not, as being more ſuitable to humanity, to have more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the beſt things of men, than to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere or froward at their worſt.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:154213:81"/>
               <p>Experience is ſaid to be the Miſtreſs of Fools, and ſhe has been ſo far my knowledge of the world, as that I have truſted and been deceived; nay, with that indulgency too, that I have not concluded men ſo bad, as I have had cauſe enough to think them; though when ſuch had been well prov'd by me, I could not have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd them ſo vile as I found them.</p>
               <p>I have this more to ſay for my ſelf, that (were it not for oſtentation) it lyes ſufficiently in my power to compare my ſelf advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly with the greateſt part of men of as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a birth as I am, (I will paſs by what ingenuity or learning belongs to them or me, leſt they take it too ill, if I do not allow them more wit and knowledge than I pretend to) wherefore I would be underſtood in manners only, to the defects of which I dare affirm, I do not finde my ſelf ſo prone as many of my degree. I ſtudy no form of words, or modes of deceit: I am neither ſo prodigal or covetous; no aſſociate of ſuch Cabals of impertinency and debauchery, as not a few of my equals are addicted to. If I have been ſo frail as to have to do with Vice, it has been alone, and with a bluſh. I ſtave off no Creditors with hard words, or put them to the expence of Suits for their own. I deal with men as I would have men deal with me; that is to ſay, plainly and juſtly: I finde enough in the world
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:154213:82"/>that I better, even in the worſt things: I am ne<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ther ſo bad as I could be, or as they are and would be; which I might take to be ſome cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to my imperfections, if they could deſerve any: and I do not pretend to an abſolute vertue. In ſum, I could never indure to render my ſelf ſo ridiculous to my ſelf, as to pretend to be more religious, or morally good, than well became my conſcience to aſſert, (notwithſtanding I obſerve nothing more commonly and eaſily counterfeited, both as to private and publick reſpects) I will therefore leave ſuch diſguiſes to men of ſuitable deſigns and intereſt: if others hold them Patriots, they ſhall be none of mine, but againſt my will. I deſire neither to abuſe my ſelf, or the world; if I do not finde cauſe to adore my deſert, I am as far from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to receive the Idolatry of other men.</p>
               <p>'Tis generally ſaid of Painters, that they figure themſelves beſt; and it may be aſwel affirmed, that men ſuitably accompliſh'd are moſt able to write themſelves: wherefore of many Hiſtories, Lives and Characters of men, delivered by the Pens of the ingenious, it would not but have been at leaſt as uſeful, if for the moſt part they had publiſhed as diligently themſelves: I ſhould much rather have choſen to read the Lives of <hi>

               <p>In the mean time, as I have received ſome ſatisfaction in communicating thus far my ſelf unto me, ſo I ſhall as willingly receive my Readers pardon for troubling him with what he has ſo little to do with: though I am fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in appearing what I am to the world, as to my thoughts: or if at any time he ſhall conceive this method uſeful for himſelf and others, I could wiſh that he would ſo far im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, and me, as to publiſh as indifferently his Figure; that I may take as deep inſpection into his, as he has had of mine.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE To the Paraphraſe on <hi>Cicero</hi>'s LELIUS.</head>
            <p>OF all the moſt exquiſite Eloquence that has proceeded from the Tongue or Pen of man, the world has juſtly allowed a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream eſteem to this Author's, of whom <hi>Pliny</hi> ſayes, <hi>Solus in toga Triumpham meruit linguae<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> lauream:</hi> Inſomuch that it may be affirmed, that <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Pen has given more honour to <hi>Rome,</hi> than the Sword of her Captains and Armies which magnanimouſly ſubdued ſo great a part of the Earth to her Dominion: Her Conqueſts we ſee (ſuitable to the common fate of greatneſs) have received a period long ſince, whil'ſt the Writings of this Author are at this day ſupream throughout the world.</p>
            <p>His Expreſſion was not more happy, than his thoughts profound. If we take him as a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, he was queſtionleſs one of the moſt learn'd of the age he lived in, or perhaps that has ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. To the Schools he came betime, yet more early flouriſhed in Eloquence; being ſaid to have been able to Declaim in Greek at fifteen years old: which ſhews us, that Wit is far more the production of Nature than Art.</p>
            <p>This Treatiſe which he calls <hi>Lelius,</hi> or <hi>De
<pb facs="tcp:154213:84"/>Amicitia,</hi> written by him to <hi>Pomponius Atticus,</hi> the Reader may perceive to have been a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue-Diſcourſe betwixt <hi>Lelius, Scaevola,</hi> and <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Romans</hi> of good account in the time they lived, which I take to be the Age next preceding his: famous in producing <hi>Scipio Affrican, Cato</hi> the Elder, both of whom receive an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mention here; but moſt eſpecially the firſt, whoſe moſt excellent vertue and converſe with his noble and worthy friend <hi>Lelius,</hi> does in no ſmall meaſure dignifie this Treatiſe, to whom <hi>Cicero</hi> gives this eſpecial Commendation in his 4th Book of <hi>Tuſculane</hi> Queſtions, <hi>Sapientiae ſtudium vetus quidem in noſtris, ſed tamen ante</hi> Lelii <hi>aetatem &amp;</hi> Scipionis, <hi>non reperio quos appellare poſſim nominatim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the ſubject here treated was wholly Compil'd by <hi>Cicero,</hi> under thoſe names; or whether he found ſome precedent matter (which I rather believe) and ſo beſtowed a poliſhing on it by his Eloquence, is not certainly known: However it were, I dare affirm that the worth of this Authors Pen does not more eminently appear in any thing written by him, than in this his moſt excellent Treatiſe of Friendſhip, the Title whereof ſhews ſufficiently its uſe and value.</p>
            <p>There are few men ſo bad, to deny the worth and benefit of Friendſhip, though I conceive the Age we live in is as little prepared to practiſe
<pb facs="tcp:154213:84"/>it, as moſt of the former; ſince we finde mens reſpects ſo much applyed to their own uſes, that it is rather a complying of Intereſt, <hi>quae ad Commodum accedit,</hi> (as <hi>Seneca</hi> obſerves) than any regard or application to worth: A conſideration that might have given me diſincou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement enough from conveying this Treatiſe into our Language and Verſe, (notwithſtanding it's repute more than ſeventeen hundred years in Proſe) though it has no ſmall reaſon to prevail on our Judgements and manners, in delivering to us how abſolutely the vertue of <hi>Rome</hi> was united to her greatneſs, and in particular that affection and eſteem her Citizens received from the goodneſs of their manners; which cannot (if duely weighed) but advantage pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private concerns.</p>
            <p>And it is ſome admiration, that from ſo omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and worthy an example as <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe vertues have been more than twenty Ages conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous to the world, ſo little has been practis'd of the precepts of ſo great a Miſtreſs: Nor had ſhe the good fortune to continue many Ages her own example, as may be ſeen by her Empires declination and fall; it being the worſt of her fate, to be ruin'd by having her Vice too exorbitant for her power to ſubdue.</p>
            <p>What I have here effected, I have Entitl'd a Paraphraſe in Verſe rather than a Poem, not only

               <l>What then is worthy Friendſhip's juſt eſteem,</l>
               <l>Which in all actions falſhood does condemn?</l>
               <l>An open heart affection does declare,</l>
               <l>Which Truth diſcovers without ſearch or care:</l>
               <l>Men fruitleſs Love, and are belov'd in vain,</l>
               <l>Unleſs their Souls improvement thence do gain.</l>
               <l>A Sycophant on him does moſt prevail,</l>
               <l>Whoſe heart reſembles his that does aſſail;</l>
               <l>Whil'ſt ſuch to Paraſites betray their ear,</l>
               <l>That ſooth themſelves, or love their praiſe to hear.</l>
               <l>Vertue her ſelf ſo wiſely underſtands,</l>
               <l>That all vain-glory has her countermands.</l>
               <l>The ſeeming good their vertue moſt do cheat,</l>
               <l>And by diſſembling Vice make it more great:</l>
               <l>Such in their feign'd repute will take delight,</l>
               <l>Whoſe manners unto goodneſs have leaſt right:</l>
               <l>With theſe ſmall concord worthy men can hold,</l>
               <l>Whoſe Tongues to blemiſh falſhood muſt be bold.</l>
               <l>If one of two obliging truth neglects,</l>
               <l>The other ſooths ſuch lyes the firſt affects.</l>
               <l>Can any judge their hearts are friendly joyn'd,</l>
               <l>When both to truth and vertue are unkind?</l>
               <l>An airy Monſter puft up thought is made,</l>
               <l>That vainly owns ſuch worth it never had;</l>

               <l>Or ſtupid guilt which flatter'd Souls does blinde,</l>
               <l>Who joy what in themſelves they cannot finde:</l>
               <l>Though Reaſon's ſight is ſeldom not ſo keen,</l>
               <l>That by it open flatt'ry 's unſeen:</l>
               <l>The occult and ſubtle, men ſhould moſt beware,</l>
               <l>Which Serpent-like glide wilely to the ear:</l>
               <l>'Gainſt ſuch our Prudence highly ſhould oppoſe;</l>
               <l>Who are but ſeeming Friends, are worſt of foes.</l>
               <l>Some I have known that would diſcuſſions raiſe,</l>
               <l>Appearing to decline their ſweetn'd praiſe,</l>
               <l>Until they greater blandiſhments invite,</l>
               <l>And give up reaſon to their fond delight:</l>
               <l>Theſe from untutor'd ſenſe receive a ſhock,</l>
               <l>As all vain-glorious Wit it ſelf does mock.</l>
               <l>But paſs we theſe imperfect deeds of men,</l>
               <l>To finiſh this high Theam, which <hi>Tully</hi>'s Pen</l>
               <l>Gives to the world, amongſt that uſeful ſtore</l>
               <l>Of matchleſs Eloquence he writ before:</l>

               <l>Know <hi>Scavola</hi> and <hi>Fannus</hi> much lov'd Friends,</l>
               <l>That vertuous Friendſhip does ſuch worth declare</l>
               <l>As it's relapſe or fall we cannot fear,</l>
               <l>In whoſe ſtability our Souls finde reſt,</l>
               <l>Though with our paſſions or deep care oppreſt:</l>
               <l>A ſplendent Love that does convey ſuch beams</l>
               <l>As kindle in mens hearts their mutual flames;</l>
               <l>The higheſt good that worthy minds can chuſe,</l>
               <l>Whil'ſt bad-mens manners only it abuſe.</l>
               <l>Who loves without ends, loves his Friend indeed;</l>
               <l>He's meanly kinde, that's kinde for his own need.</l>
               <l>Vertue does her effects enough dilate,</l>
               <l>Where good's the cauſe, men need not good intreat:</l>
               <l>The wiſe and vertuous cannot miſs their ends,</l>

               <l>What ſuiteth youth, in old appeareth light.</l>
               <l>Life's frailty does this juſt ſupport require,</l>
               <l>That good-men's aid and Love we ſhould deſire:</l>
               <l>The worth of Friendſhip laſts when life does end;</l>

               <l>In Life and Death his vertue is the fame,</l>
